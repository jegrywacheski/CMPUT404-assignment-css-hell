<span style="font-size:1.2em;">CHAPTER I</span><br><span style="font-size:1.1em">THE OPEN GATE</span>
</h2>
<p>Swirled in the maze of a slow awakening, dropped
through an abyss from zenith to nadir, the prisoner
came out of his dreams and stared through the bars
of his door to the pearl gray of the coming dawn.</p>
<p>C-45—better known in international underworld
circles as Chester Fay, alias Edward Letchmere—was
serving ten years at hard labor for the crime, committed
against the peace and dignity of the country,
of opening—by means unguessed by Scotland Yard—a
jeweler’s strong-box in Hatton Gardens; which is,
aside from “The Old Lady of Threadneedle Street,”
the strictest patrolled district in the city of London.</p>
<p>Chester Fay, alias Edward Letchmere, studied the
crack of dawn as it crept over the man-made barricade,
through the slotted windows of the great gray
cell block, and bathed the harsh walls of the prison
with the rosy light of pearl changed into ruby and
from ruby into gold.</p>
<p>And there was something prophetic in the mellow
magic of the chromatic changes in the English sky!
<!-- 010.png--></p>
<p>A bell clanged at the front of the prison. A key
grated in a lock. An iron door opened. Shuffling
feet sounded, like an old woman’s in a lane. C-45
lowered the edge of his shoddy blanket—stamped here
and there with the broad arrow—and watched where
the grated bars of the door formed tiny crosses against
the dull gray of the wall.</p>
<p>The shuffling came nearer the cell. It stopped. A
key clicked against another. The footfalls were resumed.
A surly beef-and-beer face blotted out the
light from the corridor as Chester Fay raised himself
upon his hinged shelf.</p>
<p>“C-45?” inquired the turnkey.</p>
<p>“Y—es,” breathed Fay.</p>
<p>The aged turnkey squinted at the paper he held in
trembling fingers. He eyed the door number and
blinked his matted lashes.</p>
<p>“C-45,” he said, “get your clothes on. Y’re
going hout!”</p>
<p>Had the slaty roof of the stony coffin, which he had
learned to call home, fallen down upon him, Fay would
not have been more surprised. He twisted his lithe
body, touched his bare toes to the cold stones of the
flagging, and stood erect, the heart within his breast
throbbing like an imprisoned bird.</p>
<p>The red, peering face beyond the bars, the tiny
rimmed eyes with their matted lashes, the thick purple
lips, the bulbous nose of the turnkey, represented British
justice carried to the furthermost limit of caution
and concern for His Majesty’s prisoners.</p>
<p>Fay had hated this guard over the five years at
<!-- 011.png-->
Dartmoor as he had hated the gruel and molasses served
in the morning, the stew at noon, or the gummy oakum
piled in the cell to be picked strand by strand in an
unending drudgery.</p>
<p>Now this “screw,” so called by the inmates of Dartmoor,
had delivered the sweetest words ever dropped
into human ears. Fay never knew how he dressed on
that morning. It was done. He waited and pressed
his slender body against the latticed bars, with his
ears straining to catch the iron music of the thrown
bolt.</p>
<p>The great key turned. The door swung open. Fay
glided out from his cell and stood at attention with his
fingers touching against the seams of his dirt-gray prison
trousers.</p>
<p>The guard locked the door. He peered at the paper
he held. He squinted at the number upon the stone
over the doorway, then he motioned Fay to follow him
up the long corridor of the white-flagged cell block.</p>
<p>The prisoner followed the burly form of his keeper. He
threw back his keen-cut face while his eyes lighted with
a sanguine fire that burned clear through the gloom to
the iron door of liberty.</p>
<p>This door swung open after a signal was passed between
guard and keeper. Prisoners pressed white faces
to the many bars of the place. A whisper ran from cell
to cell. The American was going free! They watched
Fay as he passed through the arch and sank back into
their narrow coffins as the great door clanged.</p>
<p>Fay waited, breathed silently, compressed his lips,
then followed the guard along a narrow hallway and
<!-- 012.png-->
into an open court, whose one high-barred gate was
flanked by two castellated towers upon which sentries
stood with rifles swung under their arms.</p>
<p>MacKeenon, of Scotland Yard, stood in the very
center of the courtyard. At the inspector’s feet a yellow
kit-bag rested. Over the Scot’s right arm a plaid overcoat
hung. Within the detective’s light-blue eyes there
sparkled the dry twinkle of recognition.</p>
<p>Chester Fay moistened his lips with the tip of his
tongue. He hesitated, then advanced step by step.
He had last seen Inspector MacKeenon on the witness
dais of the September Assizes. It was the Scot’s testimony
concerning a certain finger-print which had
carried the staid British jury. Such a trifle!</p>
<p>A sandy-colored hand crept up to MacKeenon’s chin
and covered his mouth. The eyes closed to narrow
slits. It was like a sly old dog warning another, not so
sly, not near so old. Chester Fay understood. He turned
toward the turnkey who had brought him out.</p>
<p>“Follow me, sir,” he heard him say.</p>
<p>The way led across the courtyard, through a low
stone arch and into a Bertillon room, then to where a
cold shower splashed upon well-scoured flags. The
turnkey pointed to the descending water. Fay stripped,
tossed the hated clothes away from him, lathed his lean,
long-limbed body and mopped his silver-gray hair.
It had been brown when he had entered the castellated
gate, five long years before the unexpected coming of
Inspector MacKeenon.</p>
<p>The clothes the turnkey brought had evidently come
out of the yellow kit-bag. They fitted. They were of
<!-- 013.png-->
price and rich texture. There were also the little things
which a gentleman carries—a flat, gold watch, a set
of studs and cuff-links, a pearl pin and a neat cigarette
case which contained six cigarettes.</p>
<p>Fay accepted all these things with the abstract air
of one born lucky. He did not understand the meaning
of it all. Discharged prisoners, or those released by
order of the Home Secretary, were fitted with H.M.P.
garments made of shoddy by piece-work convicts whose
hearts were elsewhere when they worked.</p>
<p>“Hall ready, sir?” asked the red-faced guard with
strange civility.</p>
<p>Fay lifted his slender shoulders slightly, adjusted
his cuffs, touched his cravat and faced the light which
streamed in through the Bertillon room. He did not
answer the turnkey. The sovereign contempt of a
caged eagle was in his glance.</p>
<p>He drew down his plaid cap which matched so well
the suit of tweeds, lowered his chin and followed the
turnkey out into the glad light of dawning day and
across the stone-flagged yard to MacKeenon’s side.</p>
<p>A prison clerk—one of those rat-eyed trusties whom
nobody trusts—hurried out from the Principal Keeper’s
office with an oblong of printed paper. He passed this
release to MacKeenon.</p>
<p>The inspector signed it with the butt of a badly
chewed indelible pencil, glanced at Fay, then said distinctly—too
distinctly:</p>
<p>“A receipt for C-45. Yea, he may b’back. Ye
canna tell!”</p>
<p>To the man who had prowled the world like a tiger
<!-- 014.png-->
a jungle—to the third cracksman living who could
open a modern cannon-ball safe or stop the four circular
tumblers of a strong-box in their correct position—this
sly aside of MacKeenon’s was enlightening. The old
gray dog, whose scent was keener than a Louisiana
bloodhound’s, was baying down the trail again for some
wolf-pack of the underworld.</p>
<p>Chester Fay set his pale face and fingered his cravat.
He dropped his hands to his side and followed the inspector
out through a rising gate, where the two men
stood facing the misted moorland and the spiring
towers of Princetown beyond the causeway. As they
stood there a clang sounded behind. It was the turnkey
bringing down the shutter of iron.</p>
<p>A sleeve-valved motor, black, tired with steel-studded
rubber, throbbing with life and a desire to roll up the
road, stood close at hand. Into the tonneau of this
car MacKeenon tossed the kit-bag and overcoat, then
turned and assisted Fay to mount the running-board,
where he had hesitated for the minutest fraction of a
second.</p>
<p>Liberty was over that causeway. Freedom might be
gained by a try at the marshes and moorland. The
mist was almost thick enough to hide in. The world
beyond was very wide indeed. The chance which
offered might never come again. Fay had lost opportunity
too often not to weigh well the one that came
to him.</p>
<p>He felt the Inspector’s fingers on his sleeve. They
seemed gentle. There was that, however, in the gripping
mystery of his release that savored of things to come.
<!-- 015.png-->
Perhaps, after all, the man from the Yard had other
plans than the underworld. Perhaps the release had
to do with the great war which had finally been brought
to an end. It would be easy to escape, for Fay had the
lithe, long limbs of the runner.</p>
<p>But he thought better of it and stepped through the
tonneau door where MacKeenon had assisted him. The
surge, as the car leaped forward and the driver glided
through second, third and into fourth speed, was just
sufficient to cause him to sit down upon the seat, where
the inspector, with solicitude, offered one half of an
auto robe whose woolen texture felt like silk to a man
who had slept under shoddy for five years.</p>
<p>The mist-shrouded moors were crossed over rumbling
bridges of planks or hollow arches of stone. The main
highway, which swung from west to east upon the
troubled isle, was reached. Into this broad road the
driver turned the great car, stepped upon the governor-throttle
and opened wide the triple-jetted carburetor.</p>
<p>A hissing of indrawn air sounded. The wind of their
swift passage struck back and cut the cuticle of Fay’s
white cheeks. They flushed and reddened with the
rush of warm blood up through his sagged veins. He
felt then the sweet wine of life and living—the clean
vision and promise of the open places.</p>
<p>He sat in one position, turning over and over the riddle
of his sudden freedom. It was like being reborn—rejuvenated.</p>
<p>MacKeenon had said no word. He crouched like a
watchful hound, ready, alert for the first overt act.
<!-- 016.png-->
Fay had weighed the chances when he had first entered
the car. They still held good. The great motor often
slowed for traffic—for the tide of war which flowed
Londonward, even after the last treaty of peace had
been signed.</p>
<p>Lorries, caissons, embarked troops in olive-drab,
invalided officers and men strolling through the rare
English meadows, all were a maelstrom where freedom
from pursuit could be had.</p>
<p>Fay feared no living man or group of men. He had
played the underworld game according to his code.
It had been a losing one, perhaps; but he had held it
down to the last grim brush with the hounds of the
law in the Court of Assizes. He had not whimpered.
He had not squealed. There was that rat, Dutch Gus,
and that pigeon, Nelly Blake, who might have stuck by
a pal. They were gone now with their telltale eyes
and their overextended sympathies.</p>
<p>Also, for he had played many parts, there was
Saidee Isaacs. Where was she now? She had been
different. A hell-cat, perhaps, but then Saidee was
a man’s girl and a lady. Had she gone up or down
during the five years at Dartmoor? Fay rather thought,
as he gripped the rare leather of the car’s upholstery,
that Saidee would be found in West London. Could
she have anything to do with his release?</p>
<p>MacKeenon, alone, could answer this riddle. He
turned his chin slightly and studied the cold face of
the Scotch inspector. There was no light in his eyes.
He sat half on the edge of the seat. His toes touched
the rug on the tonneau floor. He was prepared to
<!-- 017.png-->
spring or clap on a pair of nippers. He was the personification
of British watchfulness and sagacity.</p>
<p>The detective had played his hand, five years before,
in taking advantage of information. He had told the
truth on the witness dais, as he knew it. He had not
enlarged on the damning evidence. It had been large
enough. Down in his heart Fay did not blame
MacKeenon for testifying as he did. It had sent him
away, but then it was part of the game. It was an
added corollary to the ancient axiom: “A sleuth can
make a thousand mistakes and yet may get his quarry—the
quarry dare not afford to overlook the smallest
trifle.”</p>
<p>Noon passed. Night drew its shade across the
eastern world. The long, black motor car hurtled on
without being stopped, without question from the
decorated officers who regulated the traffic.</p>
<p>There was a hidden magic in the H.M.S. plates
which hung from the front axle and the rear trunk
rack. There was a keen hand at the wheel who
knew the turns and the signals. He drove as if the
weight of an empire depended on getting to his
destination.</p>
<p>Chester Fay, letting slip a hundred chances for escape,
found himself in the gripping clutch of the unknown
which lay before him. MacKeenon had a
plan in the back of his long Scotch head. Its very
uncertainty gripped the cracksman in a passive nip of
steel.</p>
<p>The inspector would talk, yes. Fay believed that
he would discuss the weather, the earth and the
<!-- 018.png-->
heaven above, without betraying the one thing which
was hurling them eastward at racing speed.</p>
<p>This thing was the reason for taking a prisoner out
of the living hell of Dartmoor before the long years of
penance had been up. It was unusual; it was extraordinary
save in the case where a crook squealed
and turned Crown’s evidence.</p>
<p>The Scotch inspector most certainly knew that he
had no such man to deal with!</p>
<p>The reaching fringe of London was entered. The
sky grew pale. Dusk fell with the great roaring car
brightening the asphalt road ahead with flickering,
dancing electrics of tremendous candle-power.</p>
<p>Hyde Park Corner was reached. Piccadilly lay
ahead. Sombre mansions reared on either hand. A
hospital, bright with the flags of the victorious Allies,
was passed with closed muffler. The car swerved
toward the Thames. The lamps were dimmed as the
Embankment loomed with its monuments. The
brakes went on.</p>
<p>Fay gripped his oakum-stained nails deep within
the palms of his white hands. He had a premonition
that his destination was to be New Scotland Yard.
Prisoners were sometimes taken there for interrogation.</p>
<p>The house the car stopped at, with a final clamp of
the brakes on the rear wheels, was inconspicuous
among its neighbors. It was smug and staid and held
the air of secret things. A faint light shone through
the closed blinds on the ground floor. Two iron lions
guarded the top of a small flight of well scoured steps.
A constable of the Metropolitan Police Force stood
<!-- 019.png-->
at attention as the driver shifted his lever to neutral
and touched the black visor of his cap.</p>
<p>MacKeenon set his lips and opened the tonneau
door on the right-hand side of the car. The inspector
rolled up the lap-robe, handed Fay the overcoat and
lifted the kit-bag. He paused for the cracksman
to rise.</p>
<p>Chester Fay felt the creeping fingers of the detective.
They strayed over his tweed sleeve and gripped his
elbow with no mean strength. They were like hound’s
teeth feeling for a grip.</p>
<p>“Ye coom with me,” said MacKeenon dryly.</p>
<p>Fay raised his shoulders and stepped to the running-board.
His feet glided over the curb like a quick
dancer’s. He followed the inspector, a quarter-step
behind. They passed through an iron-grilled fence,
took the salute of the constable, and reached the
landing between the two lions.</p>
<p>A dark, stained door barred the way. Upon the
right panel of this door MacKeenon knocked four
times, then five; which Fay remembered, with a
start, was his number at Dartmoor.</p>
<p>He glanced first at the kit-bag, and then turned his
head slightly and finished his scrutiny of the yard and
street. Freedom lay there in the gloom of London!</p>
<p>He tossed away what he believed was his last chance
as the door opened to a crack and then wide. There
was no alternative as MacKeenon’s fingers gripped
for a second and stronger hold. Chester Fay, alias
Edward Letchmere, entered the House of the Two
Lions, blindly.

<div class="chapter">
<h2 title="II. Scotland Yard" id="chII">
<span style="font-size:1.2em;">CHAPTER II</span><br><span style="font-size:1.1em">SCOTLAND YARD</span>
</h2>
<p>There is that within the professional criminal’s nature
which distrusts the men who carry out the laws.
The laws, themselves, may be fair, but man, in the
cracksman’s opinion, is a human element who is very
liable to overplay his part.</p>
<p>Chester Fay had lain too long on the hard planks
at Dartmoor to believe in MacKeenon’s good intentions.
The Scot had a reputation for getting results.
He was also the very keen tool of brainier men who
managed the Criminal Intelligence Division of Scotland
Yard.</p>
<p>The romance of all underworld activity on the
Continent and in England was bound up in the Yard.
Its long arm could reach down a blind alley in Paris
and snatch a man to the light of justice. It could
lift a fleeing suspect from the deck of a ship at sea. It
stopped at nothing!</p>
<p>Fay suspected a well-baited trap of the superior
order as he followed MacKeenon through a dim-lighted
hallway. He gripped his palms as they waited
in the gloom for a door to be unlocked by the servant
who had answered the inspector’s knock of four taps
and then five.</p>
<p>The room which was suddenly revealed, like the
flash of a cinematograph, contained a long mahogany
<!-- 021.png-->
table running from wall to wall, and a half-score of
heavy teakwood chairs which blended into the rich
dark finish of the wainscoting. There was little else
in the way of furnishings. Fay counted three black
tin boxes upon the table. Each box was marked with
a code number and the initials C. I. D. His eyes
lifted over these boxes and stared at a man who wore
a mask which was far too small to hide a jaw so square
and masterful. It brought a slight smile of recognition
to the cracksman’s lips.</p>
<p>The man in the mask was Sir Richard Colstrom,
Chief of the Criminal Investigation Division!</p>
<p>Fay divined, with the flash thoughts of a professional,
that the matter of bringing him out of Dartmoor
was an important one. It could be nothing
puerile with Sir Richard mixed up in the case. The
chief played a high hand and played it hard.</p>
<p>The farce of the mask was apparent when MacKeenon
softly closed the door to the hallway, turned the key,
then coughed as in a signal. Sir Richard half rose from
the deep chair in which he had been reclining and
leaned his elbows upon the table. His finger lowered
and leveled straight for Fay’s steady glance.</p>
<p>“Remove your cap!”</p>
<p>Fay smiled thinly, reached upward and brought
down the plaid cap which he bunched in his right
hand. The silver of his hair caught the chief’s eyes.
Sir Richard raised his brows and glanced at MacKeenon.
He said cuttingly:</p>
<p>“A little older—a little wiser—a little grayer than
before, eh Mac?”
<!-- 022.png--></p>
<p>“A’ hae noo doot ov it.”</p>
<p>Both men laughed at Fay’s expense. The cracksman
failed to see the joke. He stiffened slightly and
glanced about the room. The windows were shaded
and undoubtedly locked. The lamps of the place were
controlled by a switch near the door which led to the
hallway. This seemed to be the only entrance or exit
to the room.</p>
<p>Sir Richard noted the result of his thrust with a
steady glint in his eyes. He leaned further over the
table and said:</p>
<p>“I had you brought to London for a reason, Fay.”</p>
<p>The cracksman closed his fists and straightened his
slender shoulders. He distrusted Sir Richard full-heartedly.
There is that which exists between the
police and the criminal tribes which calls for no truce.
Fay was completely on his guard.</p>
<p>“I had you brought here,” continued the Chief of
Staff, “after some study of the right and the wrong in
the matter. We have your record!”</p>
<p>Sir Richard pointed toward the south and the
direction of New Scotland Yard.</p>
<p>“Yes, we have it,” he continued slowly. “It’s a
criminal shame, Fay, that a man of your ability ever
entered the downward path of crime. It leads nowhere,
and damn fast you go. You’re bucking the stream
all of the time. You can’t beat the law!”</p>
<p>Fay glanced along his tweed suit and studied the
points of his well-polished shoes. They fitted so well
he wondered if they had been made from his Bertillon
<!-- 023.png-->
measurements. He glanced up and into Sir Richard’s
half-hidden eyes.</p>
<p>“You can’t beat it—clever as you are! And, however
much we may enjoy enterprise and however many
shilling-shockers and penny-dreadfuls we have devoured,
the fact remains, Fay, that you have sadly
misapplied your splendid talents.”</p>
<p>Fay took the flattery for what he thought it was
worth. He waited with every sense keen and intent.</p>
<p>“But for you,” continued Sir Richard, shaking his
index-finger, “but for you and your kind, literature
would be poorer—we’ll grant that—”</p>
<p>Fay heard MacKeenon rounding the corner of the
table and fingering the locked boxes.</p>
<p>“We’ll grant it!” snapped Sir Richard testily.
“We’ll grant your talents. It is because of them
that we have brought you here tonight! As man to
man, Fay, we’re in a knot. I’m sure you are the one
rogue in all the known world who can help us out.
I’m going to be very candid!”</p>
<p>Fay said nothing.</p>
<p>“See these?” exclaimed Sir Richard, pointing at the
boxes upon the mahogany table. “See them?”</p>
<p>MacKeenon stepped back into the gloom of the
room. Fay followed the direction of Sir Richard’s
polished fingernail. He raised his brows in polite
query. He still remained mute.</p>
<p>“Damnit man!” said the chief of the Intelligence
Division, “Wake up! Show interest! It’s easy enough
for us to send you back.”</p>
<p>The cracksman acknowledged this threat by
<!-- 024.png-->
leaning closer to the boxes. He studied the cryptic numbers
on their sides. He turned his head slightly and
laid the plaid cap on the edge of the table.</p>
<p>“They’d be easy opened,” he offered professionally.</p>
<p>“Bah! That isn’t what we want. What we want
is this—without mincing words. We want your
coöperation. Let’s be brief as time and get to the
heart of the matter. These boxes, three in number,
contain the secrets of the entire dye industry. They
were obtained in Switzerland during the middle period
of the war. They are in cipher!”</p>
<p>“German?” asked Fay with cold concern.</p>
<p>“Yes, damnit, German! No other nation could show
such fiendish cunning in hiding so simple a thing. The
cipher is one to which neither Scotland Yard, the Intelligence
Bureau of the Army and Navy, French experts
on such matters, nor the American Secret Service
have been able to find the slightest clue.”</p>
<p>Fay had the good sense to hold his tongue. Sir
Richard was warming up to the problem. He shifted
in his chair, glanced at MacKeenon, then toward the
three boxes.</p>
<p>“The cipher,” he said, tapping the table with his
forefinger, “is either very simple or very intricate.
It is no half-way affair. It has baffled all the experts!”</p>
<p>The cracksman eyed the locks of the boxes with
professional concern. He shifted his weight from his
right leg to his left foot. He yawned politely and
passed his hand over his silver-gray hair. As yet no
trust or warmth showed in his eyes. They were
neutral.
<!-- 025.png--></p>
<p>Sir Richard adjusted his mask and leaned forward.
His eyes bored through the holes in the black velvet.
“Whatever the case may be, Fay,” he said, “the key
for this code or cipher was in the hands of a Berlin
chemist who met with a most violent death in—we
will say a country north and east of here. You can
guess which one it is!”</p>
<p>“Holland?”</p>
<p>“Perhaps. We’ll leave the matter rest with your
surmise. In this—country—north and east of here,
the German chemist did one thing before he was
slain. He left a small packet with the neutral nation’s
embassy. It was placed in their care. This packet is
of vital importance to us! It is important to your
own country, Fay. It is the key to the cipher locked
in these three boxes.”</p>
<p>“Well?” asked Fay as Sir Richard paused and thrust
out his hand. “Well, what have I got to do with all
this?”</p>
<p>Sir Richard doubled up his fingers and tapped the
polished surface of the table with his white knuckles.
He turned, threw one leg over the other and stared
at MacKeenon. The Scotch inspector nodded ever
so slightly. It was like a sly dog signaling another.</p>
<p>The air of the long room was tense as the three
men faced each other. The outer roar of London
sounded far away. The steady clank of the constable’s
feet on the hard curb was a reminder to Fay that the
house was well guarded. He thawed a trifle and
fastened upon Sir Richard an engaging smile which
was coated with clean-cut intentiveness.
<!-- 026.png--></p>
<p>“What have I got to do with all this?” he repeated,
holding forth his hands. “You’ve released me—on
parole. You’ve brought me to London. You’ve mentioned
boxes and ciphers and dye-stuff. You want
something, and yet behind me stands an officer of the
law, and outside, walks another. If you want something,
from me, why don’t you let me go?”</p>
<p>The shot was delivered through clean, white teeth.
The smile faded from the cracksman’s lips. He leaned
slightly forward and locked Sir Richard’s eyes with a
glance that caused the chief of the bureau to recoil
slightly.</p>
<p>“Yes!” said Fay hotly. “Yes, Sir Richard—oh,
I know you! You’ve gyved me! You hounded me!
You threw me in that hell-hole called Dartmoor with
the wooden-minded screws walking before my cell till
I thought I would go mad. You saw to it that I was
sent away for the limit! Now you want something,
and you won’t trust me away from your coppers!”</p>
<p>“Coppers?” asked Sir Richard removing the mask
and dropping it to the table. “What are coppers,
Fay?”</p>
<p>“Police! Screws! Guards! Turnkeys! Hell-hounds!”</p>
<p>Sir Richard stared at MacKeenon and motioned
toward the door.</p>
<p>“Go out, Mac,” he said, “and leave us to ourselves.
I think that Fay and I can come to an understanding
better that way.”</p>
<p>The inspector hesitated, walked to the door, turned
the key and passed out into the hallway.
<!-- 027.png--></p>
<p>The door closed as Sir Richard rubbed his hands,
eyed Fay with interest, and leaned back in the chair.</p>
<p>“Now,” he said, “we are alone. I’ve no doubt that
you can get away. In fact I’d hate to match myself
against you, Fay. We have your record, you know.”</p>
<p>“A lot of it isn’t true!” said Fay bitterly. “You
people are always making up things. I didn’t turn
that trick in Hatton Gardens. Why, do you think I’d
work without gloves?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t think so, Chester,” said Sir Richard with
a faint smile. “I really didn’t, but I guess you did!”</p>
<p>“Bah!”</p>
<p>“Oh, now, don’t take it that way. The strong-box
was opened—without trace. Up over the transom
was a trace—your right thumb print. It was a nice
clean job, Fay. I always thought that Saidee Isaacs
was with you that night.” The chief leaned slightly
forward. He watched the cracksman’s eyes for a
clue. There was none. Fay returned the stare without
expression. He said staunchly:</p>
<p>“Miss Saidee Isaacs had no more to do with that
job than you had or I had. I don’t even know where
Hatton Gardens is.”</p>
<p>“That’s enough! You know and I know. You’ve
got the cunning of your tribe—admit nothing and
deny everything. But I’ve taken an interest in you—a
personal one. Things have come up—”</p>
<p>Sir Richard glanced at the door and then at the
three boxes. He crossed his legs and drummed the
table. His brow furrowed as he reached forward and
fingered the velvet mask.
<!-- 028.png--></p>
<p>“Come closer, Fay,” he said confidentially. “around
here.”</p>
<p>Fay was frankly suspicious. He turned sharply and
stared at the windows. He eyed the door behind which
he sensed that MacKeenon would be crouching. He
wheeled and rested his hands on the table. He leaned
forward until his face was very close to Sir Richard’s.</p>
<p>“We can talk just as well in this position,” he said
without moving his drawn lips. “Now, what are you
getting at, chief?”</p>
<p>“I thought that Saidee Isaacs was in it,” said Sir
Richard. “I’ll take my statement back. But you were,
and I’m glad of it.”</p>
<p>Fay rubbed his wrists and stared at his oakum-stained
nails. He dropped his cuffs and stood back.
He waited with fast beating heart. The man before
him was fencing like a clever fiend. He already had
drawn speech where silence was golden. Fay remembered
with a pang that the Hatton Gardens affair
was not the only one he had been guilty of perpetrating
in the Metropolitan District of London. There was
a little matter of turning a museum off in Kensington
Gardens. There was the Monica affair where a
diamond salesman had lost a pint of uncut stones.</p>
<p>Sir Richard guessed what was passing in the cracksman’s
mind. He smiled with sudden warmth. His
head came forward as his right hand reached out.
“You think this is a police trap, Fay,” he said sincerely.
“It isn’t at all. It’s an attempt to call upon
the highest talent in the world—in his own particular
line. We all have specialties. Mine is trying to
<!-- 029.png-->
raise better dahlias than my neighbor. Yours is
opening strong-boxes which American safe-makers
have branded as burglar-proof. That big crib in Hatton
Gardens was an American box, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“How should I know?” asked Fay.</p>
<p>“Well, it was! It was made by the Seabold people
of Hartford. Guaranteed fire-proof and burglar-proof
and non-pickable. It didn’t burn up, but everything
else happened to it.”</p>
<p>Fay smiled openly. He liked Sir Richard better for
the remark. He grew more at ease as he waited.
“Well,” he suggested, “I’m here with you, and you’ve
got something for me to do. I can guess that much.
Does it concern a Seabold safe?”</p>
<p>“It most certainly does!”</p>
<p>Fay stared at the three boxes. He furrowed his
brow. They were not part of any American safe he
had ever known. They were more like the tin-cases
which middle-aged drabs carried about the Law Courts
or the Brokerage Houses. Their locks could have been
opened with a hair-pin.</p>
<p>“You’ll have to explain, chief.”</p>
<p>Sir Richard swung open his coat and drew from the
inner pocket a small notebook. He thumbed the
pages and paused at one. “Seabold Safe Corporation,
Limited,” he said. “They placed a number of
their strong-boxes in England and the Continent.
Their salespeople were very enterprising. We have
a record, from their own files, of seven. Four of the
seven were smaller than the one in Hatton Gardens.
The lock, or whatever it is called, was different.”
<!-- 030.png--></p>
<p>Sir Richard glanced up and then buried his nose
between the pages of the notebook.</p>
<p>“Two of the larger,” he said musingly, “were installed
in Paris. They’re there yet. The one that
interests us is in the country—north and east of here.
It is the same size and general dimensions as the
unfortunate one you opened in Hatton Gardens. I
understand the situation is similar—parallel. It
would be ridiculously easy for a man of your talent
to go to this country, north and east of here, and
open that strong-box—without trace.”</p>
<p>Sir Richard snapped the book shut and glanced up
at Fay.</p>
<p>The cracksman slightly moistened his lips. The cat
was out of the bag! The reason for MacKeenon’s
visit to Dartmoor—the release when five years were
yet to be served—the sudden interest of Sir Richard
Colstrom, were all explained. England, who had
severely punished him, now wanted a favor done.</p>
<p>The two men exchanged a glance of mutual understanding.
Fay’s mind worked swiftly. He went over
the details of his arrest. He recalled the method he
had used in opening the great safe in Hatton Gardens.
No other man could have done it, save by bungling.</p>
<p>“Suppose,” he said, feeling surer of his ground.
“Suppose, Sir Richard, we will say that I can go to
Holland and open that box—without trace. What
would there be in it for me?”</p>
<p>“Ah, we’re getting on!”</p>
<p>“I’m not so sure that we are getting anywhere,
for what would happen to me if I were lagged in
<!-- 031.png-->
Holland? Suppose somebody tipped me off? What
then?”</p>
<p>“You and I alone know what you are going to do.”</p>
<p>“MacKeenon?”</p>
<p>“He obeys orders. I like you, Fay. Damnit,
I admire enterprise—even if it is opening strong-boxes!
What would Scotland Yard be if there weren’t
men like you in the world? You’re a mark and all
that, but you’ve done one or two big things in your
line.”</p>
<p>Fay rubbed his wrists as if handcuffs were still binding
him. He shifted his weight and eyed the three
boxes with new concern. “My price,” he said, “may
be more than you or England are willing to pay.”</p>
<p>“No price is too high to pay for the key to this
cipher.” Sir Richard jerked a thumb toward the
black boxes. “The secret for making these dyes will
save the world from a galling monopoly. It will make
the place we live in, Fay, just that much safer for
Democracy. The war between nations is over. There
will come another war—the commercial one between
Germany and the world. We can best win that war
by being prepared—by dye-works and potash deposits
and freedom from secret formulae.”</p>
<p>Fay nodded at this statement. “My country—America—is
interested in this?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Yes and no! Your country shares with England
in every discovery. This set of boxes which contain
the cipher were obtained in Switzerland at a high
cost. Three of our men were waylaid and killed.
Two more were trapped in a Berne hotel and had to
<!-- 032.png-->
fight their way out. The German chemist who offered
the dye secrets—at a price—is dead by poison.
We got the boxes through. They contain the full
details of manufacturing thirty-six of the principal
dyes. They are in a baffling cipher which has held
us up.”</p>
<p>“And the key to this cipher is in the Holland safe?”</p>
<p>“We believe so. A friend of the man who was
poisoned brought the key out and across the German
border. He was followed by German agents. He was
in danger of his life. What was more natural than an
appeal to the embassy? They took the key, placed
it in their safe, and waited for instructions. In the
meantime the man was stabbed to death in broad
daylight, near the Schwartz Canal. His pockets were
rifled! His clothes were torn from his body!”</p>
<p>“Sounds like a pleasant commission,” said Fay
dryly.</p>
<p>“You’ll tackle it?”</p>
<p>Fay eyed Sir Richard, then reached for his cap.</p>
<p>“Does it mean my freedom?” he asked as he fingered
the visor.</p>
<p>“It certainly does, Chester! That little bit you did
in Dartmoor never happened. You were sent away,
wrong. I’ll answer for the Home Secretary. We can
arrange everything! Come now—can we call upon
you to go to that country, north and east of here, and
open the embassy’s vault without compromising us or
without leaving a trace? All we want is the key to
the cipher. If you’re not willing to make a try for it—then—”
<!-- 033.png--></p>
<p>Sir Richard hesitated and rose from his chair. He
stood with his hands clasping the edge of the table.
His jaw was thrust forward like a block. His eyes
hardened to points of tempered steel. They bored
toward the cracksman. “Take your pick, Fay!” he
said in a last appeal.</p>
<p>“Pick of what?”</p>
<p>“Getting the key to the cipher or going back to
Dartmoor!”</p>
<p>“There’s no alternative,” said Fay with a rare smile.
“I’ll turn the trick for you and England! If I don’t
turn the trick, without trace and without compromise,
then I’ll knock on the big gate at the prison and ask
to be taken in. Is that satisfactory, Sir Richard
Colstrom?”</p>
<p>“I never had the slightest doubt of you,” said the
Chief of the Criminal Investigation Division.

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">CHAPTER III</span><br><span style="font-size:1.1em">THE CIPHER</span>
</h2>
<p>Chester Fay watched the stout form of the Chief
of Division as he crossed the room, tapped lightly on
the door which led to the hallway, then waited with
his fingers toying with a heavy, gold chain which
crossed a vest the color of old wine.</p>
<p>MacKeenon turned the knob and came into the
room. He closed and locked the door at Sir Richard’s
suggestion. He sniffed the air of the room, glanced
keenly toward Fay, then said:</p>
<p>“Ye have come to an understanding?”</p>
<p>“We have!” declared Sir Richard. “Fay is with us.
You know what that means? We are bound to get
the key and trick the Germans.”</p>
<p>“A’ hae noo doot ov it,” said the Scotch detective,
rubbing his hands and peering for a second time at the
cracksman. “A verra gude mon—but a wee bit
reckless.”</p>
<p>Sir Richard laughed pleasantly. “Oh, we’re all that
way—more or less. I guess it was recklessness that
broke the Hindenburg Line. It would never have
been done if we had counted the cost.”</p>
<p>Fay moved around the end of the table and stood
by the three black boxes. He studied the situation
from every angle. It was possible to escape. It was
<!-- 035.png-->
not too late to go back on his bargain with Sir Richard.
A swift rush, the bowling over of the two detectives,
and a plunge through the shrubbery of the house would
carry him to westward, where quiet, shaded lamps and
reaching aisles of mansions would offer freedom for all
time.</p>
<p>He waited to hear more. The gripping mystery of
the cipher clutched and stilled his desire for liberty.
There would be other chances at a later hour.</p>
<p>There was something of the American in Sir Richard.
Fay watched the two detectives come across the room,
take seats at the table and then pull toward themselves
the locked boxes.</p>
<p>“We’ll begin at the beginning,” said the chief,
glancing up at the ceiling and then into Fay’s eyes.
“Take a seat, Chester, right here! I want to explain
to you about the cipher and the dye business.”</p>
<p>Fay turned and gripped the ornate arms of a teakwood
chair which had certainly come from India in
one of the old hulks. He turned this chair so that
the light from the overhead cluster would shine in
the faces of the two detectives and leave his in shadow.
It was an old trick!</p>
<p>He sat down, pulled up the knees of his tweed trousers
and leaned slightly forward in an attitude of attention.
Sir Richard had already drawn a small key from his
pocket. This key was evidently the one to the three
locks of the boxes.</p>
<p>“What do you know about German dyes?” snapped
the chief as he held out the key. “Know anything
at all, Fay?”
<!-- 036.png--></p>
<p>“I’ve heard of fast-black.”</p>
<p>“Is that all?”</p>
<p>“About all, Chief. I suppose the Germans have
gone deeper into the subject than most men. I thought
the States had made some new discoveries. You see
I didn’t get much chance to read in the last place I
was in. The subject of reading for occasional offenders
should be called to the attention of the Home
Secretary.”</p>
<p>“I’ll mention it,” said Sir Richard dryly. “I might
add that the Home Secretary and I have spent three
months on this damn cipher.”</p>
<p>Fay leveled his shaded eyes toward the boxes. He
glanced at Sir Richard. There was a frown on the
chief’s face and an angry pucker about his strong
mouth.</p>
<p>“Three months, on a cipher! Let me see it, Chief.”</p>
<p>Sir Richard turned toward MacKeenon. “Better
get up and stand by the windows when I open these
boxes,” he said. “We can’t be too careful. There is
a billion pounds involved in this!”</p>
<p>Fay was impressed for the first time since leaving
the sombre walls of Dartmoor. Sir Richard was no
man to exaggerate. He might have had the treasure
of the Diamond Clique as he reached, pulled a box
close up to his side, inserted the key and slowly lifted
the sheet-metal lid.</p>
<p>The cracksman leaned out of the shadow and into
the light. Sir Richard laid the key upon the polished
surface of the table, thrust his fingers inside the box
and drew out a sheet of white paper. He held this
<!-- 037.png-->
sheet so that Fay could read the top lines. They
were:</p>
<p>“SCHUCKER—MAINTZ—WERKE—FRANKFORT ON
MAIN—BERLIN”</p>
<p>Underneath this heading was an even row of ten-point
letters, the first of which ran:</p>
<div style="margin-left:1em; margin-top:0.3em; margin-right:0.3em;">
“aaahhhsssaaacccstopxxxgggssstttstopmmmwwwccc<br>
pppfffbbbstopxxxzzzccceeesssuuukkkwwwssstttst<br>
opyyynnnvvvfffssshhhstopmmmtttnnnpppwwwfffccc”
</div>
<p>Fay counted thirty-two rows of similar letters,
between the lines of which were double spaces of blank
white. He turned to the box as Sir Richard replaced
the sheet and snapped down the lid.</p>
<p>“They’re all like that,” said the chief bitterly.
“It’s a clever, clever cipher. A cipher that runs
through ten reams of paper. There’s all of six hundred
thousand letters in the thing. There’s at least thirty
or forty thousand words. The whole will give us the
formulae to such dyes as Alizarine Sapphire and
Carbanthrene Blue.”</p>
<p>“Might be the names of sleeping cars,” said Fay.</p>
<p>“They’re much-wanted dyes! The man who was
slain in Switzerland said the formulae to these two
colors would be found in the boxes. They may be
there, but we haven’t found them!”</p>
<p>MacKeenon lowered a blind and turned. He sniffed
with the scent of a baffled hound. The pouches at
the side of his cheeks dropped, his teeth showed beneath
curled gums. Fay wheeled upon him suddenly
and was startled at the inspector’s appearance. It
was as if the old dog had snarled in silence.
<!-- 038.png--></p>
<p>“We’ll continue,” broke in Sir Richard as he shoved
the box upon the table. “The game isn’t lost! There’s
a key to the cipher in the embassy.”</p>
<p>“Have you tried everything?” asked Fay. “How
about these cipher experts? I’ve heard they can cipher
anything. There’s a Russian in Dartmoor who used
to talk to the whole gallery by tapping on his bars.
All you had to know was the key-word and deduct
the numbers it represented from the numbers he sent.
The quotient would be the message.”</p>
<p>“We’ve tried that,” snapped Sir Richard. “Believe
me, Fay, that was the first thing tried. It’s the
Nihilist key-word cipher! Fifty of the keenest brains
in Europe and America have worked on this thing.
It does not follow Bacon’s biliteral cipher or Poe’s
cryptogram. It has some of the marks of an old
Italian cipher used in the time of Pope Alexander.
It isn’t that! It has already driven one professor of
mathematics mad. He cross-indexed it and tried it
backward. He found a queer average in the repetition
of certain letters. They followed no sane rule. For
that reason he went insane. More may go mad if
this thing isn’t solved. It represents the final triumph
over Germany—the winning of the commercial war
which is upon us!”</p>
<p>Fay drew his head back into the shadow. He still
retained the ringing timbre of Sir Richard’s voice.
The energetic chief of the Intelligence Division had
once been on a mission to the States. He had learned
much that was American on that visit.</p>
<p>“Damnit!” he heard Sir Richard blurt. “We’re
<!-- 039.png-->
not children! We have defeated the Germans on the
field of battle. Why can’t we solve a simple cipher?”</p>
<p>“What did you pay for it?” Fay shot the question
out of the shadow and watched its effect on Sir Richard’s
features.</p>
<p>“Pay for it? What do you mean, Fay?”</p>
<p>“What did you pay that man in Switzerland?”</p>
<p>“Ten thousand pounds.”</p>
<p>“And the fellow in Holland?”</p>
<p>“He died too soon to receive his share. The money
went to the general funds.”</p>
<p>Fay crossed his legs and glanced at the slender shape
of the boots he wore. “I think you have been gulled,”
he said with the ghost of a smile. “I think that cipher
in the boxes is a bum steer, if you know what that
means. You tossed away ten thousand pounds—like
that!” Fay threw out his hand expressively.</p>
<p>Sir Richard blinked both eyes. The frown died from
his face, wrinkle by wrinkle. He leaned back in his
chair, thrust his knees against the edge of the table
and said, half to Fay, half to MacKeenon:</p>
<p>“Mac thought the same thing! You’re both wrong.
The thing was tested before the money was paid.
The agent who completed the transaction in Switzerland
made no mistake. He went to extreme length
in the matter.”</p>
<p>“How?” asked Fay.</p>
<p>“He named a dye—a fast blue—which the German
chemist said was one of the thirty-six which were fully
worked out in the formulae. The chemist took the
boxes, went into a room, and came out with the
<!-- 040.png-->
formula of the fast-blue, down to the last reaction.
It couldn’t be done by any trick of memory!”</p>
<p>“That sounds plausible,” Fay said. “Then it is no
hoax?”</p>
<p>“It’s straight goods, Fay! The five thousand sheets
in these three boxes contain the chemical formulae
for the thirty-six dyes. The devil of it is, we lost the
key, in—the country north and east of here. You’re
going to get that key for us!”</p>
<p>“Just a moment. Isn’t it possible that the whole
thing is a blind?”</p>
<p>“Be clear!”</p>
<p>“I mean that the lines of letters, thirty-two or three
on each page, are there for a gull?”</p>
<p>“Go on!”</p>
<p>“They might be a gull for fools to go mad about.
The real cipher may be within the lines. That also
is a common practice at Dartmoor. Men have received
letters from the outside which are written with
lemon juice between the lines. All they did was to
heat the paper and the message came out in brown
ink.”</p>
<p>Sir Richard smiled broadly. “That has been thought
of,” he said, glancing at MacKeenon. “To be frank,
as I said, everything has been tried. We’ve even split
some of the paper. We’ve tried every reaction known
to science. We’ve bathed the sheets in oxalic acid and
iodine. There was only one clue in this direction.”</p>
<p>Fay lifted his hand and fingered the pearl-pin in his
cravat.</p>
<p>“That one clue,” continued Sir Richard, “was the
<!-- 041.png-->
report of an American chemist that he detected a salt
in the composition of the paper. It was so faint,
however, that nothing came of it. We’re squarely up
against the last card—that big gopher in the
embassy!”</p>
<p>Fay frowned slightly at the chief’s use of an American
yegg’s pet name for a strong-box. It showed Sir
Richard’s versatility, and also showed the cracksman
what manner of man he was dealing with.</p>
<p>“Gopher has gone out,” said Fay in correction.
“Only the low-brows of the Middle Western States
use it. You should say: ‘can or jug or keister.’”</p>
<p>“We’ll compromise on ‘crib,’ a good old word used
in the time of Jack Cade and other mid-Victorian
gentlemen!”</p>
<p>“All right, Chief! You want me to take it—without
trace. In it I’m to find the key to the cipher—if
there is a key. What can you say concerning the key?
Is it a book, paper or design of some kind?”</p>
<p>“Now we’re getting close!” Sir Richard exclaimed.
“It is a small packet in the back of the embassy’s
crib. It was seen only last week by a trusted agent
who could go no further. This agent informs me that
the neutral nation, north and east of here, is in a
quandary concerning it. Germany has requested that
the packet be returned over her border.”</p>
<p>“Any marks of identification?”</p>
<p>“Yes! You will always know it by a name written
in ink across one corner, under a blue string. The
name is Otto Mononsonburg—the man who was
stabbed in the back, near the Schwartz Canal.”
<!-- 042.png--></p>
<p>“Ah,” said Fay, “the matter seems easy. I get my
freedom?”</p>
<p>“If you get the packet and turn it over to me.”</p>
<p>“I’ll get it! Now a number of other things, Sir
Richard—” Fay turned and stared at the lurking
figure of the Scotch inspector. MacKeenon lifted his
hand and stroked his jaw with a sly motion. His
eyes swung from Fay’s to Sir Richard’s. They held
the glint of the manhunter and the hound. A tawny
fire was in them.</p>
<p>For the second time that evening there came an air
of tenseness into the room. Fay felt it as he watched
the Scotch inspector. Try, as he should, he could
never get over the feeling that the detective was his
born enemy.</p>
<p>MacKeenon was so like a waiting collie. The leathern
pouches of the Scot—the curl to his lips—the fang-like
teeth, all made this thing seem real.</p>
<p>With Sir Richard Colstrom there was this difference.
The chief had traveled far. He had taken the pains
to acquire some of the argot of the underworld. He
was rated square—after he caught his quarry. Fay
could never believe that a manhunter played a fair
game in running down criminals. There was too much
oral evidence to the contrary. There had been a number
of stool-pigeons in his life. To him, the despicable
thing about the game was the traitors.</p>
<p>Born a gentleman’s son and riding swiftly through
a moderate fortune, Fay had taken the easier way.
He had paid! There were other convictions beside the
Hatton Gardens affair recorded at Scotland Yard.
<!-- 043.png--></p>
<p>Freedom was a precious thing. He gripped his lips
with his teeth and counted ten before he said to Sir
Richard:</p>
<p>“One of the conditions of this matter is that I have
no hell-hounds of the law trailing me!”</p>
<p>Sir Richard glanced at MacKeenon. The two men
understood each other down to the fraction of a
glance.</p>
<p>“That’s all right,” said Sir Richard soothingly.
“You can go scot-free. All we want is the key to the
cipher. Then, afterwards, you can wear that perfectly
good suit to the States instead of donning the
broad arrow at Dartmoor.”</p>
<p>“Fine!” said Fay without warmth. “Now another
matter—”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Money!”</p>
<p>“You can have it.”</p>
<p>“I’ll need a hundred pounds, now!”</p>
<p>Sir Richard drew from his inner vest-pocket a thin
bill-fold, which he opened upon the table. From this
he extracted ten ten-pound notes and tossed them to
Fay.</p>
<p>“Count them,” he said as he replaced the bill-fold
and made an entry in the little book which he had
already consulted when giving the data concerning
the strong-box in the embassy.</p>
<p>“One hundred, correct!” said the cracksman, crinkling
the sheath of white papers. “Clean notes! I shall
have to lose a shilling on the pound with these.”</p>
<p>“That’s the rate the fences get, eh?”
<!-- 044.png--></p>
<p>Fay smiled as he thrust the bills in his tweed
trousers. “How should I know?” he inquired with
good-nature.</p>
<p>Sir Richard stared at MacKeenon. Both detectives
mirrored Fay’s engaging manner. The tensity of the
air had vanished.</p>
<p>“You’ll get another hundred pounds when you
start,” Sir Richard said, tapping the table. “When
will you start?”</p>
<p>“There’s another matter, Chief.”</p>
<p>“And that is—?”</p>
<p>“Passports and clearance papers or whatever you
call them. I understand there is still some difficulty
on account of customs. I might as well travel to
Holland, first-class. That means a damn fine alibi of
the superior order. Have you any suggestions?”</p>
<p>Sir Richard fingered the lapel of his coat. He turned
this down after thought. Fay leaned forward. He
saw a little silver greyhound pinned there. It was a
passport in a million!</p>
<p>“Do you know what this represents?” asked Sir
Richard.</p>
<p>Fay nodded his head and stared at the insignia.
“It’s the badge of the King’s Couriers.”</p>
<p>“Correct!”</p>
<p>“Do I get one?”</p>
<p>“I can tell you where there is one which can be—stolen.”</p>
<p>“Where?”</p>
<p>Sir Richard allowed his lapel to flap back.</p>
<p>He rested his elbows on the edge of the table and
<!-- 045.png-->
fastened upon Fay’s eager face the cold scrutiny of a
master advising a novice.</p>
<p>“The King’s Couriers,” he said impressively, “is an
ancient and honorable order. The members of the
office are chosen for fidelity and speed—hence the
greyhound. They can go anywhere by showing the
insignia. They need no passports or papers. Show
this to a custom officer and he will pass your luggage.
Show this little badge to a Mandarin in China or a
Zelot in Afghanistan and it is all the same. You get
through!”</p>
<p>“Where can I get one?”</p>
<p>Sir Richard beamed at Fay’s enthusiasm. “There’s
a courier living in Richmond Hill who has what you
want,” said the chief. “This courier has been to—the
country north and east of here. From this courier
you not only will obtain the little silver greyhound,
but also a detailed description of the embassy where
the key to the cipher is. I would suggest that you
turn the courier’s place of residence off tomorrow
night. We’ll give out that you escaped from Dartmoor
and entered London in some surprising manner.
What would be more natural than you robbing a house
for clothes and papers? That will let us out in case
of complications with the neutral nation.”</p>
<p>“You mean if I get caught?”</p>
<p>“Stranger things than that have happened. Now,
Fay—”</p>
<p>Sir Richard pulled down the lapels of his coat and
rose to his feet. He pressed back the chair with his
legs. He cleared his throat.
<!-- 046.png--></p>
<p>“Now, Fay,” he continued impressively, “you have
everything. The address in Richmond Hill is Number
4, Rose Crescent. Go there tomorrow about midnight
and prowl the house. Get the little silver
greyhound and talk things over with the courier—who
failed to do what you are going to do.”</p>
<p>Fay moved toward the door after picking up his cap.
MacKeenon glided to his side. The cracksman stood
erect. He turned slowly and stared at Sir Richard,
who was studying the cipher boxes.</p>
<p>“Au revoir,” said Fay.</p>
<p>The chief swung his head and rested his chin on his
chest.</p>
<p>“Same to you,” he said. “You’re hep! Now blow!
Mum’s the office, pal! The ducat and more kale will
be ready for you at London Bridge Station when you’re
ready to go. Inspector MacKeenon, the niftiest gumshoe
runner out of the Yard, will fetch them at your
order. Eh, Mac?”</p>
<p>“Weil, I don’ know! I daurna disagree wi’ twa o’
you!”</p>
<p>Sir Richard came back to respectability as he lifted
his chin and advanced his hand toward Fay.</p>
<p>“Drop around Cockspur Street and the Strand,” he
said. “Get the old, old moss out of your head, Fay.
Talk to the splendid men of your own country who
made victory possible. The town is full of Pershing’s
boys! And Fay—”</p>
<p>The cracksman’s hand was on the door.</p>
<p>“What is it?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Don’t overlook the trifles. They beat you before!”
<!-- 047.png--></p>
<p>“I’ll watch out for them!”</p>
<p>“And, Fay—”</p>
<p>“Y—es!”</p>
<p>“Don’t look for Saidee Isaacs. Go right to Number
4, Rose Crescent and turn the house off. You
know how to do that!”</p>
<p>Fay was half through the doorway. Sir Richard
made a signal for MacKeenon to draw back. The inspector’s
face clouded as he caught the order. He
peered around the edge of the chamfering. His eyes
snapped like a wiry terrier’s as he heard the swift
patter of footsteps on the pavement.</p>
<p>“He’s goon, mon!” he said. “Fay’s goon!”</p>
<p>“Good!” said Sir Richard.

<h2 title="IV. Saidee Isaacs" id="chIV">
<span style="font-size:1.2em;">CHAPTER IV</span><br><span style="font-size:1.1em">SAIDEE ISAACS</span>
</h2>
<p>Chester Fay felt the grip of a London night as he
dodged in and out of the neatly boxed trees that lined
the street upon which was the quiet house of the Two
Lions.</p>
<p>He did not glance back. He knew that only amateurs
did things like that. The five years in Dartmoor had
taught him that liberty was a priceless thing. There
were guards and constables on that dark street. Some
turned and watched his fleeting form with suspicion.
Any moment one might call a halt. Every second, he
expected to hear a shout from MacKeenon.</p>
<p>The high tower of Westminster loomed over the
housetops. Beyond this tower was the House of
Parliament. At its base ran the sullen flood of the
Thames. Over the river a bridge arched, strangely
pale in the night light.</p>
<p>Gripping his palms, and somewhat surprised to find
the overcoat over his arm, he turned at the Embankment
and there swept the street with the corner of his
eye. No man followed him. A single constable, half
curious, had stepped out on the asphalt. He stood
like a post, his hands on his bent knees.</p>
<p>“Adieu, sir,” Fay laughed lightly. “Adieu, you
there, and you Keenon and you, Richard. You both
<!-- 049.png-->
would have let me rot in that hell on earth if you hadn’t
needed me. From now on, I’m a free agent! And the
world is wide.”</p>
<p>Breathing the night air, Fay hurried toward the east.
His shoulders were squared and his heels and toes
clicked over the hard stone without visible effort.</p>
<p>He walked in the same swinging gait until he reached
the place where the black shadow of Cleo’s Needle
lifted against the leaden vault of the London sky.</p>
<p>Here he turned and leaned over the Embankment’s
rail, The tide flowed slowly toward the city and the
sea. Bridges arched from shore to shore. Great caravansaries
loomed with their staring windows arranged
in shelf-like tiers. Beyond them sounded the roar of
midnight traffic.</p>
<p>A sudden loneliness came over him. He was without
home or friends. The years at Dartmoor had effaced
many memories. They left one which was overpowering.
How little was human effort. There had been
a time when flash thieves with international reputations
had pointed him out at the St. James and Alhambra
Lounge, as the king of cracksmen. The time
was gone. The old crew had either been caught or
had died overseas on the red fields of Flanders. Few
served or continued their profession.</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs loomed before him. He searched the
Thames and found her face there. He closed his eyes
and marked her flashing presence. He saw her dark
hair, her lashes, her olive cheeks and Madonna smile.
That same smile could change between the time of
seconds to hate and rage. Dutch Gus, who should
<!-- 050.png-->
have known, had called her the Mona Lisa of the
underworld.</p>
<p>Fay wondered where she was living, as he tore his
glance away from the river and turned with his back
to the wall. He had last seen her on that eventful
day when a cage had shot up in the court of Assizes,
a judge had pronounced the sentence, and the cage,
with him in it, had dropped down to the waiting van
which had started for the prison with both horses on a
gallop.</p>
<p>Her mouth had formed one word: “Courage!”</p>
<p>He recalled all this as he struck the wall with his
right heel. There was little enough honor in the best
of thieves. The stool-pigeons had made squealing a
profitable vocation. Men who traveled with golf-bags
filled with highly tempered tools of the safe-breaking
profession, and who sported small black motor cars of
marvelous speed, were proper marks. The pigeons or
carelessness or something had dragged him down.
Fay often wondered, in those Dartmoor years, if Saidee
Isaacs had a hand in his conviction.</p>
<p>MacKeenon would not give him Saidee’s address.
Sir Richard had told him to forget her. He decided,
with a sudden start as Big Ben struck the quarters, that
the day that had been ushered in would be devoted to
finding Saidee Isaacs. She had some things to answer
for—chief of which was her reason for not writing
to Dartmoor.</p>
<p>He straightened, hung the coat over his arm, fished
out a cigarette from the case, and struck a match upon
the damp stone and hurried away from the river.
<!-- 051.png--></p>
<p>Suddenly, and specter-like, a form blocked his way.
It was an American soldier clad in a well-fitting olive-drab
uniform, upon the sleeves of which was a wound-stripe.</p>
<p>“Say, mister,” Fay heard. “Say, will you show me
the way to my hotel? It’s the Huntington, I guess.
You guys in this burg call it different. You call it the
’Untin’don, or something like that. D’ye know where
it is, Chappie?”</p>
<p>“Surest thing you know, old pal,” said Fay, shifting
the coat and linking his arm under the soldier’s. “Come
along with me—I’m going right that way!”</p>
<p>It was at the square, where the red mass of the
Huntington Temperance Hotel juts out into the Strand,
that the soldier disengaged Fay’s arm and stared at
him.</p>
<p>“Say,” he said, “are you a bloody Britisher?”</p>
<p>“Surest thing you know.”</p>
<p>“You don’t look like one.”</p>
<p>“Looks are skin deep, my friend.”</p>
<p>The soldier accepted a proffered cigarette from Fay’s
gold case, glanced at the tip, then declared as he
reached for a match:</p>
<p>“They may be skin deep, Chappie, but you remind
me of the States—New York! If you’re a Yank, why
didn’t you get in the fight?”</p>
<p>Fay had no ready answer for the thrust which most
certainly went home. He covered his confusion by
accepting the half-burnt match, then he laughed
lightly.</p>
<p>“Why didn’t I go to the fight?” he temporized.
<!-- 052.png-->
“I’ve got a good reason—a very good one. I was
never invited.”</p>
<p>“Ah, go on!”</p>
<p>“Besides,” said Fay, “I guess the fight is over.”</p>
<p>The soldier glanced at the black band on his arm.
“You’re an American?” he insisted.</p>
<p>“Well, suppose I am?”</p>
<p>“And you came over here without a uniform?”</p>
<p>“I’ve worn a uniform for five years,” said Fay
truthfully.</p>
<p>“What service?”</p>
<p>“The King’s own!”</p>
<p>“Gawan!”</p>
<p>“Surest thing you know. And now, my friend,”
he added, stepping back, “I’m going to leave you at
the Huntington—not ’Untin’don! Some day, when
you go back to the States and to Broadway, just drop
into the Café Ponsardine and tell the chap at the desk,
in front, that you saw Chester Fay. Tell him—you’ll
know him by a bald spot, and a scar on his chin—that
I’m working for Scotland Yard. He may drop
over when you tell him that. He may buy you a
drink!”</p>
<p>“Ah, say!”</p>
<p>Fay was gone with a finishing laugh. He turned
into the Strand and hurried eastward. He knew of a
place where often he had spent the night when the
Yard was close on his heels in days gone by. This
lodging for a night was run by an ex-fence who bought
only diamonds out of their settings or large Bank of
England notes. Clanson was his name.
<!-- 053.png--></p>
<p>Fay turned a corner, leaned against the wall and
lighted a cigarette in the shadow of a doorway, within
which was a deep, blue light. A constable stood across
the street in an attitude of resignation. There was no
other name for it.</p>
<p>The cracksman shifted his coat from his right arm
to his left, dropped the cigarette to his feet and stepped
briskly toward the same corner he had rounded. It
was an old trick of a man who feared a shadow. He
saw none. A “growler” or four wheeler, drawn by a
decrepit nag, rattled over the asphalt, going toward
the West End.</p>
<p>Assured, Fay turned and hurried up the side street
until he reached a small temperance hotel, at the side
of which was a shop bearing the ancient and honorable
title of: “M. Clanson, Dealer in Antiques and Foreign
Monies.”</p>
<p>Fay found a handle which he pulled twice, then
twice more after a five-second wait. He repeated
the signal, known of old. A light showed at the back
of the shop. It came toward the front. Clanson, in
night cap and with a candle held over his head, pressed
his bloated face to the dusty pane of the door. His
nose grew white on the tip, as he stared at Fay. He
drew back with a smirk and started removing two chains
and rattling at least one key. The door opened on a
third chain.</p>
<p>“A passenger from the west,” said Fay, using an old
countersign.</p>
<p>Clanson growled and closed the door. The last
chain was guided from its channel. The door opened
<!-- 054.png-->
wide. Fay stepped in briskly. He did not look back
of him.</p>
<p>“From the west,” he said as Clanson locked the door.
“I’ve a scratch or two I want changed.”</p>
<p>“Let’s see,” said the ex-fence, staring at Fay and then
at the drippings from the candle. “It’s been six, no
five years, since you were in here. Much water has
flowed through the Thames since then.”</p>
<p>“And some blood,” said Fay, laying his coat on the
top of a dusty show-case within which was a collection
of Japanese and Javanese daggers with wicked-looking
points and yellow ivory handles. “Some blood,” he
added, turning and reaching in his pocket.</p>
<p>Clanson nodded his gray head. He stared at the
front of the shop, then at Fay’s hand, which came out
with the ten-pound notes Sir Richard had given to him.</p>
<p>“Two and six off the pound,” he said craftily.</p>
<p>“Then,” said Fay, peeling off one half the notes,
“I’ll keep a few! Funny, too, these happen to be good.”</p>
<p>Clanson blinked and counted the sheath. “Five,”
he said, dryly. “That’s makes six pun and five bobs—off.
How’ll you have it, Edward? Let’s see, wasn’t
it Edward? You had so many.”</p>
<p>Fay watched Clanson and the candle vanish into
the gloom of the shop. Minutes passed wherein he
could have obtained a collection of daggers and jade
paper-knives. Clanson was opening his strong-box.
The old rogue, who once said, “If there were no receivers
there would be no thieves,” evidently thought
the Bank of England notes were stolen property. Fay
had no other way in all London to change them.
<!-- 055.png-->
Besides, it would be possible for the Yard to trail him by
the numbers on the notes.</p>
<p>Clanson came back, deposited the candle on the showcase
near Fay’s tweed coat, and started counting out
newly minted sovereigns with fingers that were loth
to see them go.</p>
<p>He finished the count with two one-pound Bank of
Ireland notes and a stack of bright shillings.</p>
<p>“There’s forty-three, fifteen,” he said. “All nice new
money. Times was when you brought me more than
that, Edward.”</p>
<p>Fay pocketed the coins and bills without counting
them. He thrust his right hand under his coat, wheeled
and stepped briskly to the door.</p>
<p>“So long!” he drawled as Clanson peered out, then
turned the key. “Oh,” he added as a subtle afterthought,
“what have you heard of Saidee Isaacs?”</p>
<p>The ex-fence coughed before he answered: “Little,
lad! A gentleman was in from the west the other day—a
fortnight ago, who asked the same question.
Stout gentleman who used to come with you, Edward.
Dutch—Dutch—”</p>
<p>“Dutch Gus!” snarled Fay, with his eyes flashing.
“That rat?”</p>
<p>“He asked about little Saidee Isaacs. I told him
the same as I tell you. I know nothing. A lady like
her—with her motor car and her slavy or two, don’t
happen this way often.”</p>
<p>“Motor car?” asked Fay blankly.</p>
<p>“The same, lad. Twice I saw it. Once in Cockspur
Street, once in Piccadilly, at Berkeley Street.”
<!-- 056.png--></p>
<p>Fay fastened upon the old man a glance which
flamed white fire. “Open the door!” he said, swinging
his coat. “Let me out! Me rotting in that hell-on-earth
and she in a—”</p>
<p>Clanson stared after the form of Fay as he darted
over the street and swung westward. Then the ex-fence
closed and chained the door.</p>
<p>There is a cab-stand where Regent Street leaves
Piccadilly. To this stand Fay hurried, sprang into a
two-wheeler, and said very distinctly to an ancient
driver:</p>
<p>“Park Lane!”</p>
<p>“’Ow?” asked the driver.</p>
<p>“To Park Lane, very quickly.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, sir,” mumbled the driver, climbing up
the back and tilting the shafts to a dangerous angle.
“Gee-up!” he added, cracking the whip.</p>
<p>Fay stopped the cab at the corner of Hyde Park
where Oxford Street is joined by Park Lane. He sprang
out, tossed the leaning driver two bright shillings and
started south toward the looming shadows of many
mansions.</p>
<p>Reaching Hyde Park Corner he struck westward in
a long swinging glide. The hour was after two. The
night was a black pocket, blurred here and there with
blue jewels from the arcs.</p>
<p>He had planned to take a night’s rest at the hotel
which flanked Clanson’s Antique Shop. The dealer’s
statement concerning Dutch Gus, and, moreover,
Saidee Isaacs, changed this plan. He wanted to walk
in the wide places. No trace of drowsiness weighed
<!-- 057.png-->
his eye-lids. Shepherd Bush—the Thames—Richmond
and Hammersmith, were ahead of him. There
was no law in England that prevented a man taking the
road. Fay went on, with his oakum-stained nails
gripping his palms, his eyes set ahead and slightly upward
where the yellow vault of the London sky pressed
down on his throbbing temples.</p>
<p>He came, but not by design, to hedge-ensconced
villas and the many winding lanes of Richmond Hill!</p>
<p>“Number 4, Rose Crescent,” flashed through his
brain. This was the address given to him by Sir
Richard Colstrom.</p>
<p>He glanced under the long shelf of boughs which
stretched toward the south and the river. The sight
was a pleasing one, despite the night’s dew. Smart
driveways, box-hedges, clumps of well trimmed trees
and the ghostly outlines of Queen Anne cottages and
villas showed that he was in one of the better parts of
London.</p>
<p>He glided along the grass, momentarily expecting to
be accosted by a constable. The hour was almost
three. The chimes of Big Ben were somewhat distant.
The roar of the city was far away. The smug dwellers
of Richmond Hill were wrapped in slumber.</p>
<p>Rose Crescent proved to be a circular drive, bordered
by plane trees whose trunks were encased in iron-grilled
railings. Neat curb-steps bore the names of
the owners. A lodge-house was passed with the gates
closed and barred.</p>
<p>The numbers on the curb-stones or on top of the steps
started running down as Fay hurried toward a cross
<!-- 058.png-->
road and the barrier of a high hedge which enclosed
some vast estate.</p>
<p>He stopped as he reached Number 6. The next
villa would be the address mentioned by Sir Richard.
Fay stepped to the curb and glanced up and down from
under the shelter of an overhanging bough. No one
was in sight!</p>
<p>Turning swiftly, he darted through the shrubbery of
Number 6 and tiptoed along the driveway. The gravel
crunched slightly as he worked toward the back of a
stately villa. He stepped to the grass, listened a
moment, then dropped to his hands and knees and
crawled through an opening in a hedge. He rose,
strained his eyes, and stared up at the wall before him.</p>
<p>A mansard roof, gables on the corners, well-curtained
bays and wide porches, denoted one of the smartest of
London houses. A small garage at the end of the
driveway had room for two motor cars. A side house,
well hidden in shrubbery, probably contained the
servants. The all, in the night’s gloom, was a picture
to charm most any prowler.</p>
<p>Fay studied the lower windows, with a professional
glance. He drew himself back into the hedge as he
heard a click and then the sound of somebody moving
at the front of the villa.</p>
<p>Steeled and alert, he waited with every nerve tingling.
The first sound was followed by the slight grating of
feet upon a porch. A blurred and well muffled head
was thrust around the edge of a white post. Sharp
eyes searched the shrubbery and the hedge. Fay remained
motionless. He held his breath.
<!-- 059.png--></p>
<p>Then and shrillingly, there came a signal from the
other side of the villa. The head on the porch was
jerked back. A burly form leaped to the grass where
the driveway turned about the house. This form rebounded,
stood erect, then came lumbering toward
Fay and the back of the villa.</p>
<p>The shrill cry of warning was repeated. Fay drew
himself into the smallest possible shadow. A man
lunged past him. This man’s face was revealed for a
moment like a flash seen on a picture screen. It was
unmistakable. It was memory haunting.</p>
<p>“Dutch Gus,” breathed Fay, hardly daring to move.
“That’s Dutch Gus.” He heard the crash of glass as
the prowler stepped through a low greenhouse. A fence
broke under a man’s weight in the back of the garage.
Afterwards came profound silence, until a far-off dog
barked and signaled the man’s passing.</p>
<p>Fay waited. It was barely possible that things
would quiet down. He had heard no sound from the
villa.</p>
<p>The mystery of the affair gripped him in a passive
vise. Dutch Gus was the last man he had expected
to see in that part of London. MacKeenon or even
Sir Richard might have visited the villa. A King’s
courier lived in the house, from all information. Then,
asked Fay to himself, what was the connection between
Dutch Gus, the lookout, Sir Richard and the
owner of the villa? The entire matter was bound
up in some manner with his quest after the cipher’s
key.</p>
<p>Fay had lived alone too long to believe that the
<!-- 060.png-->
presence of the crook in that neighborhood could be
laid to chance. He had often studied the law of
chances. They were infinite in the matter of meeting
a friend or enemy in a strange locality. The police
never caught their quarry through the chance meeting.
It was always by a lead or a given direction.</p>
<p>He turned the problem over in his quick way as he
waited for some development from the villa. He had
no fear for himself. The night was too dark for
pursuit. There were innumerable side lanes and turns
and twists to that part of London. The constables
were either asleep or dozing in sheltered nooks.</p>
<p>Glancing upward, after emerging from the hedge,
Fay studied the windows on the side of the villa. No
light shone from any of them. A light would have
been an indication that Dutch Gus and his lumbering
get-away had aroused the occupants.</p>
<p>The absence of any light was disconcerting, however.
It would be equally easy for someone inside to keep
watch without revealing his presence. In fancy he
saw a lower curtain move. He dismissed this notion
as time passed. He waited, realizing that nothing
would be gained by a retreat. He was on the grounds
of the villa he had been told to prowl. His coming
there had frightened Dutch Gus into a bungling get-a-way,
which was some satisfaction after all.</p>
<p>The warp and woof of the cipher affair would very
likely prove a tangle of many lives. Fay had not yet
decided that he would go to that country north and
east of London and open the strong-box in the embassy.
He had not felt a call for patriotism in the enterprise.
<!-- 061.png-->
Rather, the matter would have to shape itself. He
distrusted the police and Scotland Yard from bitter
experience. And now, despite his efforts to the contrary,
fate or chance had brought him to the very
house that Sir Richard had wanted him to prowl.</p>
<p>He dropped to one knee, finally. Swiftly rolling
the coat into a small bundle he pressed it under a bush.
Rising and listening with his senses alert, he poised
upon his toes, then started toward the nearest window,
which was the rear one of a huge bay.</p>
<p>Reaching this, after avoiding the gravel walk by
stepping over it, he crouched beneath the sill and pressed
his ear to the frame-work of the wall. His hearing was
cell-matured and acute. The presence of anybody
above him, or any movement in the house, would be
instantly detected. He heard no one.</p>
<p>Working swiftly, he tried the window. It was locked,
as he expected. Reaching upward, after pulling on a
pair of gloves which had been in the pocket of the coat,
he climbed by means of a vine and a ledge to the sill,
where he cupped his hands and studied the lock.</p>
<p>It was the ordinary kind he knew so well. There
was a thin-bladed knife on the end of his watch-chain.
He drew this out and ran its blade between the sashes.
He struck the upper sash with the palm of his hand.
He pressed the lower sash and found the catch moving
on stiff pivots. One more try and the lock was in the
off position. He waited then, ready to spring to the
ground or raise the window.</p>
<p>No sound came from the house. Fay bent his back,
reached down with his left fingers and slowly raised
<!-- 062.png-->
the window. The opening he made was not over a
foot in height.</p>
<p>Stooping and grasping the sill, he thrust his feet
through, turned his body and squirmed inside. He
straightened swiftly and waited. Nothing happened.</p>
<p>Soft curtains barred his way to the room. He
reached out and pressed these aside with cool fingers.
The scent of a Japanese perfume greeted his keen
nostrils. Within this scent was another—the faint
odor of heliotrope.</p>
<p>Frowning slightly, he wondered at this. It brought
memories with its fragrant essence. Years before,
somewhere, he had known that peculiar sweetness. It
lifted him, and brought to his mind what he had
missed in life’s great game.</p>
<p>Stepping forward, he moved amid the furniture of
the room, caught his directions by instinct, which is
given to animals and prowlers, and passed through a
double door whose panels, down to the rugs, were tiny
crystals of glass.</p>
<p>He reached the opposite side of the villa from which
he had entered. He opened a catch and raised a window
so that a hand-hold was between the sash and sill.
Satisfied that he had two avenues of escape, he went
back through the door of cut-glass and stood in the
center of the first room.</p>
<p>Gradually, his eyes brought out the splendid details
of the furnishings. Soft pillows mounded box-couches
and cozy nooks. Tapestries and portières hung along
the walls. A dark-wood stand was at his right hand.
Upon this was a cloisonné tea set and a lacquer tray.
<!-- 063.png-->
The gold arabesques of the tray came through the
gloom. A dragon stared at him.</p>
<p>“Nice place,” he thought. “One of these hundred
pounds a year affairs.”</p>
<p>He felt then, rather than heard, the movement of a
curtain at the front of the room. A slight chill swept
through the air. It was as if someone had swished
by.</p>
<p>Fay, alert and crouching, blinked his eyes in the
direction of the danger. He lowered his hands and
half turned toward the window by which he had entered
the room. It was too late. A switch snapped
upon the wall. A blinding glare sprang from a score
of frosted bulbs. The cluster overhead seemed to explode
with light. The room and all its details were revealed
within the time of two seconds.</p>
<p>A woman stood between the portières which separated
the front parlor from the room with the bay.
A pair of very determined eyes flashed over the blue-steel
of a medium-calibre revolver of superior make.
Above the eyes was a pink night cap. Beneath the
extended arm, which was as steady as a marksman’s,
Fay saw the soft sheen of a pair of pajamas which were
partly hidden by a belted bathrobe.</p>
<p>He neither backed away nor changed color. He never
had feared a gun. He stood, half turned away from the
menace of the revolver. His eyes accustomed themselves
to the blinding light. His hand raised and
bunched his plaid cap from his silver-gray hair. He
bowed as the woman lowered the revolver and let it
dangle at her side.
<!-- 064.png--></p>
<p>“Chester Fay!” she exclaimed.</p>
<p>The cracksman’s manner might have been Chesterfield’s
as he swept the floor with his cap.</p>
<p>The little lady with the business-like revolver was
Saidee Isaacs!

<h2 title="V. At Daybreak" id="chV">
<span style="font-size:1.2em;">CHAPTER V</span><br><span style="font-size:1.1em">AT DAYBREAK</span>
</h2>
<p>Chester Fay had the saving grace of lightning analysis.
He had received the surprise of his life without
showing it. The sweep of his plaid cap, as he bowed to
Saidee Isaacs and straightened himself with lithe
swiftness, had allowed him time to piece together a
number of things.</p>
<p>He stared at her with a quizzical smile that illumined
his keen features and disarmed suspicion. Sir Richard,
old in the ways of the world, had managed the meeting.
The presence of Dutch Gus was as yet to be explained.
The events of the night, however, were closely woven
together. Fay did not believe that chance or coincidence
played the slightest part in the matter.</p>
<p>The long arm of luck had not caused him to enter
the one house in all of London where Saidee Isaacs
dwelt. Nor did the long arm of coincidence bring
Dutch Gus to that part of Richmond Hill. The Yard,
the girl, the cipher and the presence of the German
crook were all one web, woven in a pattern.</p>
<p>“Well?” said Saidee Isaacs. “Well, Chester, when
did you get out?”</p>
<p>Fay fingered his cap and stared directly into the
girl’s brown eyes. They were soft but he had seen them
flash livid fire on more than one occasion.
<!-- 066.png--></p>
<p>“When did I get out?” he repeated. “When did I?
You ought to know!”</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs tapped the thick rug with her silver-buckled
slipper. She glanced down her dark lashes
and uncocked the revolver with a practiced motion.</p>
<p>“Why should I know?” she asked, glancing up.</p>
<p>“I think you had a hand in it!”</p>
<p>“You do?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs swished her hair back from her forehead
as she removed the lacy night cap and tossed it upon
a divan. “Come sit down,” she said, “and tell me
about it. Tell me, Chester, why you think I had anything
to do with getting you sprung.”</p>
<p>“‘Sprung’ is good,” said Fay, tossing his cap after
the dainty one.</p>
<p>“But,” he added, “I don’t like to think that you let
me rot in that place for five years—without writing
a line.”</p>
<p>“I had a reason!”</p>
<p>“Well, it’ll have to be a good one. We quit, Saidee,
if it isn’t! What does all this mean?” Fay swept
his hands about the room. He stepped swiftly toward
the portières and parted them. He darted a quick
glance around a well-cushioned and thick-rugged
parlor. “Who’s upstairs?” he asked, turning and coming
back to her.</p>
<p>“Jealous?” She was sitting on the divan as she
asked this question.</p>
<p>He flamed, with the red blood mounting his white
cheeks and burning his temples.
<!-- 067.png--></p>
<p>“Who’s upstairs?” he asked in deadly earnestness.</p>
<p>“Nobody!”</p>
<p>“Nobody at all?”</p>
<p>“I’m all alone.”</p>
<p>“The servants?” Fay glanced toward the rear of
the room where a half-door to a butler’s pantry showed.</p>
<p>“They are having a night off. Besides,” she added
swiftly, “I was expecting you. I didn’t think you’d
bungle things as you did. I heard you on the porch.
You stepped on the electric rug, Chester. It didn’t
remind me of old times, at all.”</p>
<p>Fay’s brain worked swiftly. It was evident that
Saidee did not know that Dutch Gus had attempted
to pay her a visit. He closed his lips, sat down on the
divan at a discreet distance, and studied her from the
corner of his left eye. She had not aged since last he
had known her. The rings on her fingers were more
splendid than he had ever seen her wear. The shadow
of a frown crossed his features as he noted a necklace
about her throat.</p>
<p>She tapped the rug, with a cold smile bringing down
the corners of her mouth. She turned then and stared
at him. His eyes stared back at her. Neither moved.
Fay tried to read what was transpiring in her mind.
He caught the scent of heliotrope from her negligee.
It softened him with old memory. He leaned closer,
hardly daring to breathe.</p>
<p>“Chester,” she said finally, “you’re the biggest fool
I ever knew. You’re always making mistakes. That
finger-print! That slip in Paris, ten years ago. And
now, you stepping on a rug and blundering about.
<!-- 068.png-->
Why didn’t you come straight to me—not like a thief
in the night?”</p>
<p>“I came the way I was sent!”</p>
<p>She arched her brows. “The Yard don’t send their
agents that way,” she said.</p>
<p>“So!” said Fay, “you know! You got me out
so I’d be a stool-pigeon for Sir Richard. That’s it—is
it?”</p>
<p>“A stool, Chester? Think what you’re saying.
Think of the old, old days when we were going dead
wrong. Why, this is a different thing!”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, Saidee?”</p>
<p>She smiled inscrutably, which was her ancient charm
to him. Her eyes glowed as she reached out an overly
jeweled hand. “All bets in the crook game are off,”
she said with American directness. “They’re off for
a time, Chester. I got you out of Dartmoor for bigger
game.”</p>
<p>Fay had never fully understood Saidee Isaacs. The
riddle-woman was strong in her. She was two natures
as wide apart as the poles. She could hate
stronger and longer than anybody he had ever known.
Her love, which had never been given to any man,
would mean all in all.</p>
<p>“You,” he said bitterly, “were long in getting to
this big game. It’s been five years, plus one day,
since you told me to have courage, in that court room.
That was just after the beak pronounced the limit.”</p>
<p>“Kindly refrain from slang, Chester.”</p>
<p>“Oh, you!” he snapped, with his eyes flashing.
“You—you lady! Since when? I suppose you’ve
<!-- 069.png-->
forgotten the Maiden Lane affair or the pint of uncut
stones we switched on the sucker who came up from
the Cape. I—”</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs had risen and stood facing him. “Another
word,” she said, “and it’s all off between us! I
had you sprung, to use your old slang. I used my influence
with Sir Richard. I told him that you were
the only living man who could open that box in Holland,
without leaving a trace. He mentioned other box-men—Sheeney
Mike and Foley the Goat and little Eddie
Richards. They’re all doing bits in England. You
were my choice, and he sent for you!”</p>
<p>“How about the Hatton Gardens affair influencing
him?”</p>
<p>“It did, in a way,” admitted the girl as she narrowed
her eyes. “But the main thing was that he had sent—somebody
who failed. That somebody came back
and recommended you. It’s a hard safe to crack.
It’s well watched. Besides, Sir Richard wanted it
done without trace.”</p>
<p>Fay felt more at ease as he motioned toward the divan
with his left hand. “You seem to know a lot about
this, Saidee. Were you the King’s Courier? Do I get
a little silver greyhound from you?”</p>
<p>She hesitated and then sat down. Her hands folded
in her lap. The jewels glittered and flashed the white
fire from the electric globes. Her eyes widened. An
elusive smile lurked in their corners as she turned to
him.</p>
<p>“Of course not!” she said archly. “Do you think
I could open a big safe like you can? You foolish boy!”
<!-- 070.png--></p>
<p>“I’ve phoned Sir Richard my house might be burglarized
and report that the thief stole a silver greyhound
and some clothes. That’s only an alibi for
Scotland Yard in case of international complications.
You know they might happen.”</p>
<p>Fay moistened his lips and leaned back against the
cushions. Saidee had offered a naïve explanation which
hardly rang true. She had not explained how clothes
and a King’s messenger happened to be in a rather
smart Richmond Hill villa.</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re too deep for me,” he said frankly. “I’ll
take your word, Saidee. I always have. Come across
with the badge and the diagram of the embassy. Sir
Richard said I would get them here at Number 4.”</p>
<p>“What time is it?”</p>
<p>“Almost daybreak,” he said, glancing from the dial
of his watch to the windows. “I haven’t had a bit
of sleep since the screw woke me up this—yesterday
morning, and told me to get my clothes on. Think
how I felt!”</p>
<p>“The screw?”</p>
<p>“Yes! The damn blear-eyed, sneaking cockney
who counted me so often I thought he’d wear my
buttons off. Five counts a day in Dartmoor, Saidee.”</p>
<p>“Do you think it pays?”</p>
<p>“You’re no one to ask me that!” Fay shot the
statement through clean, white teeth, then studied its
effect on the girl at his side.</p>
<p>She tapped the point of her slipper upon the rug,
rose, glanced toward the half-door to the butler’s
pantry, and said:
<!-- 071.png--></p>
<p>“I’ve squared it, Chester. Come, and I’ll make
some tea and a little lunch. I want to show you how
quickly one can climb up when they quit fighting,
fighting the police of the world.”</p>
<p>Fay walked by the girl’s side, then fell one step behind
her as she led the way through a curtain and down
a passage to a kitchen which was illuminated by a
single wall cluster.</p>
<p>He stood erect on the well-scoured tiling and glanced
about with amazement. There was everything in
the culinary art within the four white walls. A wine box
showed with its drip pan. A row of many shaped
glasses, arranged in half-dozens, stretched along two
shelves. A cocktail-shaker hung on a hook. A recess
above the glasses was filled with dark bottles whose
seals spoke of price and age.</p>
<p>Bins, drawers, an electric-stove, half-barrels, china
with a tiny gold crest, knives and silverware, were at
the further end of the kitchen. A door was set in the
wall, through which the servants passed. Fay eyed
this door as he asked:</p>
<p>“Who paid for all this?”</p>
<p>“Jealous?” asked the girl, as she placed a pot on the
stove and snapped on a switch.</p>
<p>“Who paid for it?” he repeated hotly.</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs wheeled and came toward him. Her
eyes were no longer the inscrutable pools of dark
brown. They flashed and drove him back toward the
wall.</p>
<p>“Who paid for it? I did!” she exclaimed. “How
do you think I got it? By wiles or guiles or knavery?
<!-- 072.png-->
By lowering myself to a moll-buzzer or a store hister?
No, and you know it! I earned it, Chester Fay!”</p>
<p>“In five years?”</p>
<p>“Yes—in less! In four years! I want you to
take back what you said.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say anything, Saidee. I didn’t—”</p>
<p>“Well, you were going to!”</p>
<p>Fay smiled and only increased her anger. “You
thought something,” she said staunchly. “You have
no right to ask me who paid for this house or the things
in it.”</p>
<p>“I take it back,” said Fay, glancing toward the
electric-stove. “The water’s boiling, Saidee,” he
added. “Let’s start all over again. I’m beginning
to like this little kitchen.”</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs shaded her eyes with her lashes and
switched off the current. A Japanese pot came out of
a closet. Two cups followed it. Tea was made as
Fay watched her moving swiftly over a sideboard upon
which she sliced tongue, bread and a heaping mound of
old English fruit cake.</p>
<p>“Bring up a chair!” she commanded. “Bring two!”</p>
<p>He moved the chairs over the tiling and offered her
one. She drew it to her side, turned and stared at his
hair. “I noticed that first,” she said, softening her
voice slightly. “It was brown when you went in.”</p>
<p>“It was! It would have been white instead of gray
if you hadn’t seen Sir Richard. Ten years of that hell!
Look at my nails.”</p>
<p>“I noticed them,” she said, meeting his eyes. “Do
you think there is anything in crime?”
<!-- 073.png--></p>
<p>“Not lately,” Fay blurted as he seated himself.
“Pass the tea, please.”</p>
<p>She poured the cup full and poised the Japanese pot.
“You’re going to square it now?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I may!”</p>
<p>“I want you to promise. I want you to go to Holland
and open that strong-box. I don’t want you to
fail me. Remember it’s me! Sir Richard and the
rest don’t count. You’re doing it for me, because I
recommended—”</p>
<p>“Ah,” said Fay, “then it was you?”</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs bit her lower lip. “I had a hand in
it,” she said. “But you mustn’t think I went to Holland
or anything like that. The party who went there—failed.
I don’t fail as a rule!”</p>
<p>Fay glanced keenly at her. She returned the stare
bravely. Her breast lifted and fell as she breathed
with emotion. “I did what I could for the Yard,”
she added quickly. “I have the diagram of the
embassy. I have the little silver greyhound, which is
to be your passport.”</p>
<p>“Is it effective?”</p>
<p>“Tremendously so! Why, everybody just makes
way for you when you wear it. It’s a magic talisman
these days, Chester.”</p>
<p>Fay reached for the cake and poised a slice over his
tea cup. He studied the pattern on the little silver
spoon. It was monogrammed “S. I.” The cup was
also marked with her initials.</p>
<p>“I like this place,” he said with naïveté. “I was
worried all the time that you would go clear down and
<!-- 074.png-->
out. And here you’re living like a princess of the blood.
How do you do it?”</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs pushed back the chair and rose. She
glanced down at Fay with an intent expression. Her
long, dark lashes gave a silken look to her eyes.</p>
<p>“I’ll get the diagram,” she offered, moving toward
the door which led to the front of the house. “Don’t
ask so many questions! Take what you get!”</p>
<p>“One fine little girl,” he thought as he watched her
vanishing form. “But,” he added, munching on
the cake with his chin lowered, “she’s dangerous,
and I know it. Wonder what she did to earn all
this?”</p>
<p>Saidee reappeared, closed the door and laid an envelope
upon the sideboard. She sat down after pouring
out more tea. She tapped the envelope with her
fingers, hastily tore across one end and dumped out a
folded piece of white paper and an object done up in
thin yellow tissue.</p>
<p>“This is the silver greyhound,” she said, “which
only King’s Couriers are supposed to wear. You
prowled this house tonight and opened my wall safe.
You could do that blindfolded. I paid five pounds for
it, and there’s only three hundred possible combinations.”</p>
<p>Fay showed professional concern as he took the
silver greyhound from the girl’s fingers and held it out
appraisingly.</p>
<p>He pinned it to the right lapel of his tweed coat and
leaned back. “Now the map,” he said. “The little
diagram the gay-cat got in Holland.”
<!-- 075.png--></p>
<p>“I told you to be careful with the slang, Chester.
‘Gay-cat’ is very bad form. ‘Courier’ would be
better.”</p>
<p>“Let me see it!”</p>
<p>Saidee opened the paper and laid it down between
the two tea cups. It was a well-done diagram of the
main floor of a splendid house. The streets were named.
The locality of the safe was shown in red ink. Beneath
the diagram was a notation which Fay saw was
in Saidee’s handwriting—fine and precise.</p>
<p>“Read it,” he asked, straining his eyes.</p>
<p>“Oh, it goes on to say that a very wise little safecracker
will find an American strong-box with two
dials and a dial-keister. The day door is secured by a
flat lock which probably can be picked. The safe
stands on a concrete and tile flooring. There is a
space overhead hardly big enough for a man to secrete
himself. The sides of the safe are in plain view of two
streets.”</p>
<p>“Go on,” said Fay as Saidee Isaacs glanced up.
“That’s your handwriting. I still think you went to
Holland.”</p>
<p>“Be careful! Don’t tell all that you think, Chester.
You’ll spoil our midnight party.”</p>
<p>“It’s almost a daylight one!”</p>
<p>She glanced at a pantry window. “Gray dawn,”
she said musingly. “The cold, gray dawn, Chester.”</p>
<p>“And time I’m going, I suppose,” he said, reaching
and taking the diagram. He held it before him and
ran his eyes to left and right over the paper. His
glance was the keen darting one of a professional.
<!-- 076.png--></p>
<p>“This stairway?” he asked, pointing toward a series
of shaded lines. “Where does that lead?”</p>
<p>“Down to a basement.”</p>
<p>“What’s in it?”</p>
<p>“Rooms, where some of the embassy’s staff spend
the day. There’s no one there at night. The guards
are outside. One watchman stays by the safe. He
usually sleeps from three to four-thirty. He gets
coffee, then, from a woman who brings it to him.”</p>
<p>Fay glanced at her without betraying his mood.</p>
<p>“This packet Sir Richard told me about?” he asked.
“This cipher’s key, done up in paper with string around
it and a name across one corner, is where, Saidee?”</p>
<p>“On a top shelf in the keister. You’ll have to go
through the day-door, the outer door and the keister
door before you reach it.”</p>
<p>Fay arched his brows and leaned over toward her.
“What’s upstairs?” he inquired.</p>
<p>“More rooms and offices. Sometimes the embassy’s
staff work all night in the front chambers. You can
usually tell by a light in the front. If there’s no light
then the staff has completed its work and gone home.”</p>
<p>“Very precise, Saidee. You’re clearing up things,
nicely. Also, you’ve been there for the Yard. Nothing
on this earth could make me believe that you haven’t.”</p>
<p>“Finish your tea,” she said, “and come into the other
room.”</p>
<p>Fay pocketed the diagram and fingered the little
silver greyhound as he rose and followed Saidee Isaacs
through the doorway.</p>
<p>She stood near the divan but did not motion for him
<!-- 077.png-->
to sit down. Her eyes fastened upon his tweed cap
close by her own. She gathered her lips into a sympathetic
pucker as she asked:</p>
<p>“Have you any money?”</p>
<p>Fay tapped his trousers pocket. “Plenty,” he said
lightly. “I’ve money and more money coming. The
clinking quid, Saidee! Remember how we went after
it, once?”</p>
<p>“We took the wrong road, Chester.” She turned
and stared at him. Her eyes opened and studied his
silver-gray hair. His keen, white features and rounded
chin brought her over the years and then back again.</p>
<p>“You promise me,” she asked, “that you will go
straight? That you will get a sleep at some respectable
hotel and meet whom you are to meet tonight? That
you will remember me on your trip to Holland?”</p>
<p>Fay reached and picked up his cap. He remembered
that his overcoat was beneath the hedge outside the
window. There was one other matter. He moved close
to her side and touched the sleeve of her bathrobe.</p>
<p>“Saidee,” he inquired in a deadly level voice, “when
did you see Dutch Gus?”</p>
<p>He had expected a surprise. Her arm grew rigid.
Her head turned and flashed the jewels of the necklace
till they dazzled his eyes. The olive purity of her face
changed to a flushing rage. She swished around,
jerked her arm from him and shot a shimmer of fire
from beneath her dark lashes.</p>
<p>“Dutch Gus! That man? He followed me to
Holland! Now you know! He queered my mission
for the Yard!”
<!-- 078.png--></p>
<p>“Queered it?”</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs paced the floor of the room. Her eyes
shone tawny and fire-laden as she came up to Fay and
grasped his shoulder.</p>
<p>“Promise me you will <i>get</i> him!”</p>
<p>“Sure! Where is he?”</p>
<p>“In London, somewhere. He’s in with a mob of
Germans and Austrians who are after the dye cipher.
They found out where I was going—why I was going
to Holland. They didn’t have the nerve to attempt
the safe, Chester. They didn’t! They waited until
I tried—and failed. They stole my luggage coming
back. They kidnapped my French maid. They did
everything. They may <i>do</i> more!” Saidee Isaacs
reached swiftly and snatched up the revolver.</p>
<p>“Take this, Chester! You may need it!”</p>
<p>“Go easy,” said Fay as he felt the revolver slipping
into his pocket. “Go easy, Saidee. You better keep
it here. Dutch Gus was trying to prowl the house
when I got through the hedge. It was him on the
electric door-mat. I didn’t—”</p>
<p>“Are you sure?” Her voice lowered and gained in
timbre. “Are you sure, Chester?”</p>
<p>“I saw him trying to pick the front-door lock. He
heard me coming or got a signal. He dashed for the
back of the house and the garage. He went through
the greenhouse, by the sound he made. Always
clumsy!”</p>
<p>“That was him!” She reached and lifted the revolver.
She cocked it and lowered her right hand.
“I’ll keep it,” she said determinedly. “You switch
<!-- 079.png-->
out the light and leave now. If he comes, I’ll empty
all five cartridges into him. I’d do it gladly!”</p>
<p>Fay started toward the switch on the wall. He
glanced at the long windows. One was up where he
had left a possible escape. The light of a London
morning showed through this opening.</p>
<p>He snapped off the switch. The two stood in the
center of the room as he stepped back to her side. He
felt her presence in deep breathing. A softness came
over him. It was five years since he had talked to a
woman.</p>
<p>“Saidee,” he said. “Dutch Gus won’t bother you
now. It’s daybreak. You know him! He never
works in the light!”</p>
<p>“But tonight I may—”</p>
<p>“Tonight I leave for Holland—or elsewhere.
What do you say we chuck the job for the Yard and
take up the old trail? There’s Havre and the other
ports where American gold flows. There’s Monte
Carlo, still doing business. The world is torn wide
open. We can clean up a million.”</p>
<p>“And get caught!”</p>
<p>“No! I’ve the greyhound and my old nerve. We
can go toward the north and west and double back by
way of Stavanger, Norway. We can work the boats.
The commercial war is on! What will the cipher do
for us? The Yard will thank me if I get it, and perhaps
remit that five years I owe to Dartmoor. That’s
all I’ve got to look forward to.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it enough, Chester?”</p>
<p>“No!”
<!-- 080.png--></p>
<p>“But then you’ll be clean! You can come to me
with open hands, and I’ll be here. Crime has had its
day!”</p>
<p>Fay moved toward the window. “Good-by,” he
said, lifting up the sash and peering out. “Good-by,
Saidee,” he added as he glanced back in the half-gloom.</p>
<p>“Where are you going?”</p>
<p>“Somewhere to think it over.”</p>
<p>She glided over the rug and reached for his arm.
Her face pressed close to his. He felt her hot breath.
Her eyes burned a message into his own.</p>
<p>“You’re going to square it?” she whispered tensely.</p>
<p>“I’ll think it over.”</p>
<p>“You’re going to square it?” she repeated as her
fingers clutched tighter about his sleeve.</p>
<p>“Yes,” he said hesitatingly.</p>
<p>“Promise me, Chester.”</p>
<p>“I promise.”</p>
<p>“And you’ll meet those people at London Bridge
Station tonight?”</p>
<p>“MacKeenon?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“I’ll keep the meet.”</p>
<p>“You have your cap and the diagram and the greyhound—the
little silver insignia that keeps a man
from harm?”</p>
<p>“I have them, Saidee!”</p>
<p>“Then go, quickly!” she said, leaning down. “Go
and get the cipher-key. It means so much to you—and
the world!”</p>
<p>“Adieu!” he breathed as he thrust his legs through
<!-- 081.png-->
the window’s opening and touched the ground with
his toes.</p>
<p>“Au revoir, pal,” she flashed with her old fire. “Go
now and get ready for the game! Good-by, Chester
Fay! Good-by!”</p>
<p>He heard the sash softly close as he turned away
from the house.

<span style="font-size:1.2em;">CHAPTER VI</span><br><span style="font-size:1.1em">EDGED TOOLS</span>
</h2>
<p>The grip of a London dawn was in the air as Fay
rounded the hedge, within the foliage of the house
next door to Saidee Isaacs’. He found his tweed overcoat,
into the pockets of which he crammed his gloves.</p>
<p>He went out then into the silent lane and struck
toward the east with long swinging strides which carried
him past constables, early morning workers and the
heavy lorries which were streaming Londonward.</p>
<p>His eyes were sanguine and held high. His elbows
bent at his sides. The absence of sleep from the
moment he had been awakened by the turnkey at
Dartmoor was unnoticed. He was free! The world
was wide! And there was a woman in it for him!</p>
<p>He thought of Saidee Isaacs as he hurried along.
She had come up out of the underworld. She had
prospered and gained in strength and beauty. More
than these two things, she represented the entire sex
to him. He knew that the five years of prison life
had glorified women and lowered men in his estimation.</p>
<p>The mystery of her position, her close touch with
the Yard, her willingness to send him on the mission
to Holland, which was bound to prove dangerous,
caused him concern as he reached Hyde Park Corner
and passed the iron-grilled fence of Apsley House.
<!-- 083.png--></p>
<p>The City roared a warning. The rattle of busses
and cabs over the pavements clashed with his thoughts.
It was all new and terrifying to one who had never
known fear. He felt, instinctively, that he was being
followed. He fled eastward without glancing behind
him. He reached the entrance to Berkeley Street and
turned northward.</p>
<p>The two emotions struggled with his soul. Five
years of silence and solitude had left their mark.
The constant eyes of the guards in the prison still
were there. He felt them in the center of his brain.
They haunted, despite his attempt to dismiss their
presence. His early buoyancy died.</p>
<p>He was passing through the experience that every
released prisoner knows. He was fagged from lack
of sleep. The excitement of the game to come had
worn off. There remained only weariness and
dejection.</p>
<p>A park, hedged about with plane trees and towered
over by neat boxed-houses, brought him to the realization
of his locality. North, lay Brooke Street and
Oxford. A mews was at his right, between two mansions.
He took this narrow passage, passed hostlers
grooming horses, and emerged upon a street which
would lead him to Soho Square and Burlington
Arcade.</p>
<p>He came, with the same swift glide, to a coffee house
under the sign of a brown cup. There he wheeled and
flashed a defiant glance back and over the street. He
searched each face that passed him. He swept the
throng. No one of all of them was familiar. He was
<!-- 084.png-->
not being followed. The thought had been the distillate
of a tired brain.</p>
<p>Braced on two cups of black coffee, and quieted
by the dragging fumes of a cigarette, he went on into
the city and was swallowed up by the three
who toiled and cheated and gamed out the day.</p>
<p>The alchemy of sleep—in a Soho hotel noted for
its cleanliness—removed the last vestige of weariness
from his mind. He glanced at his watch as he called
for cold water and plenty of it. He bathed and dressed
hurriedly, then took stock of his possessions.</p>
<p>There were the cuff-links and the pin and the
cigarette-case which MacKeenon had brought to
Dartmoor. There were the tweed coat, the little
silver greyhound, and the bank notes and gold. More
than these was Saidee’s diagram of the embassy. He
studied this before opening his door.</p>
<p>The plan flashed over his brain. He memorized the
details like a draughtsman reading a white-print. He
closed his eyes and repeated each item. Then, and
naturally, he struck a match on his heel, held out the
blazing paper and dropped its ashes along the narrow
hallway where they would never be noticed.</p>
<p>Keen-brained from the sleep, and with eight hours
ahead of him, he plunged into the opening meshes of
the game. There was much to do in that short time.
A plan had already mapped itself out. It would not
do to go to Holland without every necessary tool for
the operation of opening the strong-box. These, he
knew, were to be found at a certain shop on Ludgate
Street.
<!-- 085.png--></p>
<p>He strolled north and east through familiar lanes.
He stopped now and then, and glanced at the windows.
His actions, though natural, had one purpose. The
Yard had let him go free. And yet, he knew, there
were serious-faced young men about who were waiting
for him. It was not in the cards that Sir Richard
and MacKeenon would remain passive. Every inspector
from that dingy house near the Embankment
had received orders to watch out for any overt act
on the part of Chester Fay, just out and dangerous.</p>
<p>The many faces of the crowd flowed before him like
a stream. He registered each one, but found none
upon which he could fasten his suspicion. The Yard
and Sir Richard would be more than keen to know
how the great safe in Hatton Gardens had been opened.
They had declared at the time that it was by far the
best piece of cracksman’s work ever done in the city.</p>
<p>Fay had the pride of his profession. Secrecy was
the one thing which had been ground into him. He
moved off from the windows and plunged into the
throng of drab clerks and shoppers. He twisted and
turned and retraced his steps. He dropped into the
Tube and came out again. Satisfied, then, that there
was no shadow behind him, he turned into Ludgate
Street and sought for the shop.</p>
<p>It had been over five years since his last visit. The
sales people surely had forgotten him. He glanced up
at the familiar sign and entered. He made his way
along aisles of polished cases and came to a protection
ledge behind which was an array of medical instruments
laid out for inspection.
<!-- 086.png--></p>
<p>The salesman who stepped out of the gloom with
an encouraging smile was the same who had been
there five years and more before. Fay realized this
fact with quick intuition. He watched the man’s face
for some sign of recognition. There was none.</p>
<p>“My eldest brother,” he said with a winning smile,
“has sent me to you. He’s stationed in Mesopotamia.
Rather far from here! He cawn’t come himself, y’know.
I’m a bit doubtful if you remember the Sir Roderick
Findlayson who went with the expedition. He practiced
up St. John’s Woods way.”</p>
<p>The salesman rested the tips of his fingers on the
polished case and puzzled his memory.</p>
<p>“Awkward of me, but I just can’t now. Is there
anything I can do to help you out?” he asked.</p>
<p>Fay was on rather thin ice, and he knew it. The
instruments he wished had queer names among the
medical profession. It was possible the salesman was
not a surgeon.</p>
<p>“Yes!” he blurted. “You can help me out. My
brother—Sir Roderick Findlayson—wrote for me
to send him certain things. Unfortunately I lost the
letter. But I remember about what he wanted.”</p>
<p>The salesman glanced at the case beneath the array
of instruments. “We have the largest supply in London,”
he said. “Could you pick what you want from
this assortment?”</p>
<p>“Well, there was a satch—, a doctor’s bag, for one
thing. Something nice in black alligator. Say a three-pound
bag. Would it be about this long?”</p>
<p>Fay spread his hands to show two feet in length.
<!-- 087.png--></p>
<p>“We have that size in genuine alligator for three
and ten.”</p>
<p>“Nicely!” said Fay. “I take one. Now,” he added,
“I may as well pick out the instruments for my
brother. You can get the bag later and put them
in it.”</p>
<p>The salesman opened the case and started lifting
up trays filled with highly polished instruments. Fay
set aside a tempered artery-forceps which would also
answer to turn a key in a lock. It was known in the
underworld as an “insider.”</p>
<p>“My brother,” he said lightly, “will be pleased with
this. Now what is that big instrument?”</p>
<p>“That is used in obstetrics.”</p>
<p>“Just what he wanted. Put that with the forceps.”
Fay shaded his face and smiled. The obstetric instrument
when taken apart would make a high-grade
jimmy.</p>
<p>He leaned down and indicated a tray. “Three of
those,” he said, pointing to bone saws which could be
employed equally as well against wood or iron.</p>
<p>The salesman polished these with a piece of cheesecloth
and laid them on top of the obstetric instrument.</p>
<p>“I think that’s all at this counter,” said Fay, eyeing
the collection. “The next will be rubber gloves and
collodium. You see my brother has many infectious
cases.”</p>
<p>The salesman opened the back of a near-by case
and brought out samples of gloves. Fay inspected
them as the clerk went for the collodium, which was
a sovereign cure for finger-prints.
<!-- 088.png--></p>
<p>Fay’s next purchase seemed an afterthought.
Without it he would have been an amateur. It was
a very high-grade stethoscope, such as army doctors
and surgeons use to determine the right ventricle’s
action or the little flaws and flutters of the human
heart. It had been made by one of the greatest houses
in London. The clerk insisted that it was powerful
enough to hear a fly walk ten feet away.</p>
<p>Fay arched his brows at this statement.</p>
<p>“How about the chest?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Perfect, sir. All one has to do is to press it to the
left breast and place on the ear-pieces. The instrument
registers every valve motion and defect.”</p>
<p>“Your price?”</p>
<p>“Eight pound, ten—the same price we charged
the British Royal Flying Corps. They were used
extensively in the examination of the flying men.”</p>
<p>Fay had another purpose for the stethoscope. It
worked equally as well upon the door of a strong-box
just over the combination dial. This is the nearest
spot to the padded slots into which certain tumblers
drop with a tap which would sound like a bolt falling
by use of a sensitive micro-phone diaphragm.</p>
<p>“I’ll take it!” he snapped. “That completes my
purchases. Now, let me see the bag.”</p>
<p>The bag proved all that the salesman claimed for it.
Fay fondled each instrument, laid them in position,
and turned the key in a little nickle-plated lock.</p>
<p>He paid his score and was out in the street, pressing
his way like a doctor on a hurried call. He caught his
reflection in a window. It was of a British surgeon, in
<!-- 089.png-->
cap and long tweed coat, carrying the little insignia of
the office. He expected momentarily to be grasped
by the arm and led to a street accident.</p>
<p>The matter of the instruments had been carefully
thought out. There remained a second purchase equally
as important. Fay was doubtful of the propriety of
purchasing a heavy-caliber revolver in the open shops.</p>
<p>He turned into Cheapside and sauntered along. An
ancient armorer’s sign caught his darting glance. He
crossed the pavement and stared into the window.
A half-circle of British regulation revolvers lay in the
center of other hardware. Also, there was a blue-steel
American automatic with a business-like muzzle.</p>
<p>Fay smiled at this as if greeting an old friend. Mike
the Bike and Big Scar, of western memory, always
carried a .44 automatic. They called them “maggy-guns”
or “smoke wagons.”</p>
<p>He went inside the shop and explained to the proprietor
that he was en route to Mesopotamia. “I’ll
take that American revolver,” he said. “That, and
one hundred cartridges. Never can tell what the Turks
are apt to do.”</p>
<p>Emerging from the armorer’s, with the automatic
clinking against the tools in the bag, he glanced at the
time. It was three o’clock. Fog was drifting across
the dome of St. Paul’s. He had five hours before
meeting MacKeenon!</p>
<p>Swirled now with the first grip of the game, he decided
to visit one or two of his old haunts. No one
would be likely to know him in the guise of a British
surgeon.
<!-- 090.png--></p>
<p>He chose to first drop in at the Monica, and from
there make his way to “Jimmy’s” or the St. James
Hotel, which at one time was a meeting place for
international celebrities and flash denizens of the
underworld.</p>
<p>The long bar at the Monica was strangely free from
patrons. Fay ordered Rhine wine and seltzer, which
was equivalent to a soft drink.</p>
<p>The bar-maid turned away as he spun a shilling
over the bar. Fay, on the alert, and with the doctor’s
bag between his feet, caught a glance exchanged
between the girl and a lone figure at the end of the
bar.</p>
<p>He sipped the drink and searched his brain for an
answer to the signal which he had detected. It came
to him with sudden flash. The man was from the
Yard. The girl had recognized an old acquaintance in
the plaid-capped visitor.</p>
<p>Fay acted with the quick wit of the professional.
He glided along the bar and held out his hand. The
smile he bestowed upon the inspector broke down a
staid Scotch reserve.</p>
<p>“Well, have you found him yet?” he asked cautiously.</p>
<p>The man from Scotland Yard winced.</p>
<p>“I mean Dutch Gus,” whispered Fay.</p>
<p>“No!” The answer was solemn and from the heart.</p>
<p>“And it’s been five years?”</p>
<p>“Six and a piece.”</p>
<p>“You’re waiting for him to come in here?”</p>
<p>“Here or the other places. Can you help me out,
Edward?”
<!-- 091.png--></p>
<p>Fay went back and lifted his bag. He passed close
to the inspector, on his way to the doorway.</p>
<p>“I never peach,” he said through tight lips. “But,
if I ever change my mind, that’s the man I’ll squeal
on first. Good-by, MacPhee.”</p>
<p>Fay burst through to the street and the drifting fog.
He had acted on the spur of the moment in speaking
to the inspector. The long watch at the Monica bar
was a sample of the work of Scotland Yard. It had
once been a favorite rendezvous of Dutch Gus and his
mob. The watch was still being kept for the German
crook who had learned safe-breaking in the States
during the palmy days of the Chicago Drainage Canal.
He had transgressed once too often, in the estimation
of Sir Richard Colstrom.</p>
<p>“And they’ll lag him,” said Fay, turning toward the
south. “MacPhee never lost a man.”</p>
<p>He became thoughtful as he reached Blackfriars
Bridge and crossed the Thames to the Surrey side.
He still had three hours before meeting MacKeenon
at London Bridge Station. He had forgotten his
intended visit to “Jimmy’s.” The presence of the
inspector on watch at the Monica bar was food for
thought. There seemed no way of escaping the nipper
grip of the Yard.</p>
<p>MacKeenon, Sir Richard, MacPhee, Saidee Isaacs,
the cipher and the evil visage of Dutch Gus appeared
in the fog as Fay leaned over the Albert Embankment
and stared toward the curtain which blotted out
London. Fingers seemed to reach and clutch for him.
Coils were thrown. There was the south, and Brighton
<!-- 092.png-->
and the Cape boats, for a get-away. The bag with its
gun and surgical instruments could be tossed in
the Thames. No man could catch him, if he chose
to exercise caution. The world was wide, and a new
life in another country could be started without
suspicion.</p>
<p>He felt in a reflective mood. Belligerency would
follow this mood as certain as the dawn would rise on
foggy London. He recalled the ancient vows of getting
square with the police of the world. The five years
of cell life—of waiting and watching—had not
shaken him from his purpose to gain a little place in
the sun, and there bask with the smiles of those he
cared for and understood.</p>
<p>The cipher mission had not gripped him in the
manner it should. He did not see the great commercial
war which was settling upon a torn world. The
factories of London, Manchester, Leeds and the Scotch
districts might be pouring their smoke into the English
air in an attempt to stem the tide of imports from over
the North Sea. They were building the last battlements
of a people who would be free. He did not care! Had
not England penned him for five long years in a living
hell? Was that punishment to be forgotten lightly?
Was it a reason for falling in with the plans of Sir
Richard and the hounds of the Yard?</p>
<p>He smiled bitterly. He wanted freedom of action.
He had the wherewithal to gain this desire. The
money in his pocket, the open road to the south
through Surrey, and a change of costume would effect
an escape. There was no way to prove that the Yard
<!-- 093.png-->
would not send him back to Dartmoor if he failed in
the Holland mission.</p>
<p>He turned away from the stone rail and stared
through the gloom to where arc lights were stretched
in an unending row. They shone blurred and torch-like
in the murky air. Beneath them, pedestrians
and lorries moved, like a procession of sad mourners.
It was the tide of London folk pouring home at the
day’s end.</p>
<p>Tapping his heel against the black bag at his feet,
he saw from the corner of his right eye the arched
bridges which spanned the Thames. They, also, were
thronged with a dark mass of outpouring humanity.</p>
<p>He seemed alone. He was in the backwater of strife
and bustle. An open space was between his position
at the rail and the nearest sidewalk. This space was
shimmered over with damp mist. Across it, flashing
eastward, there passed a smart, black motor car, with
a driver bent at the wheel and a single figure in the
tonneau.</p>
<p>Fay heard, as distinctly as if the voice had been at
his side, a call and a warning. It rang in his ears after
the car had vanished in the shadowy street on his left
hand. He repeated the words: “Look out, Chester!”</p>
<p>“Now, who in the devil was that?” he asked himself,
standing erect and glancing after the car like a
thoroughbred who had scented danger.</p>
<p>The mystery of anyone in London knowing his
name or figure, gripped with strength. He wondered
if the voice that struck across the night had been a
guilty tug at his own brain. It could hardly have been
<!-- 094.png-->
real. He recalled that the car was smaller and of less
horse-power than the one which had brought him up
from Dartmoor. It was not the same motor. Nor
had there been “H.M.S.” plates on its trunk rack.</p>
<p>The roar of the city confused him as he waited. It
was possible that he had but reflected his own thoughts
when he heard the warning. He dismissed the matter
and started to turn toward the river. His chin had
described half a circle when there flashed across his
vision the true warning of coming danger. It had
taken him many years of training to act as he did.
He ducked, stepped aside and sprang out and away
from the stone rail.</p>
<p>A hurtling form, bunched and aggressive, crashed
past him and rebounded from the stone. A bitter
oath cracked the night. A man straightened and
jabbed with a long dagger. Fay backed and held his
hand in a warding position. It was Dutch Gus who
faced him. The German crook had missed his prey
by the scant margin of an eye flash.</p>
<p>Fay acted with the lightning dart of a professional
wrestler. He knew the mettle of the man he faced.
Dutch Gus was over-burly. He lacked the fine points
of the thoroughbred. He held the knife like a bayonet—before
him, with no chance to recover if he missed
the stroke.</p>
<p>The jab missed by narrow inches. The crook stumbled
from the force of his wasted blow. Fay twisted
his head, stooped down, grasped the German about
the hips, and flipped him over his shoulder. Dutch
Gus crashed against the stone rail and hung there.
<!-- 095.png--></p>
<p>Fay reached and swiftly opened his little black bag.
From this he drew the revolver and held it against the
German crook’s head. He cocked the trigger. He
waited. He thrust the man further outward. A
coward’s cry sounded as Fay pressed Dutch Gus over
the rail and down toward the murky flood of the
Thames.</p>
<p>A splash was followed by silence. The ripples
widened and merged with the pall that hung over
the river. Out of this murk there rose an arm, and then
the blond head of Dutch Gus. He treaded water and
then sank.</p>
<p>“Curse you!” said Fay, clasping the weapon and
waiting for a sight. “Curse you, Dutch Gus! I wonder
if that’s your end?”</p>
<p>Fay turned, backed against the rail, and searched
the gloom on the Surrey side. He waited grimly for
other evidences of the ambush. He saw none, although
it was hardly possible that the German had acted
alone.</p>
<p>It came to him, as he uncocked the automatic,
that in some unknown manner the German had gotten
wind of the project to Holland. It flashed through his
brain that, after all, there was a reasonable answer to
the attempt on his life. Dutch Gus had followed
Saidee Isaacs. It was no coincidence then, that she
had called from the tonneau of the black car and her
trailers had discovered his presence. The thing
worked out. He pocketed the automatic, picked up
his bag, glanced at the river, then started toward
London Bridge Station. It was seven o’clock.
<!-- 096.png--></p>
<p>As he moved swiftly, his eyes searched the throng
across the pavement. He wondered if a shadow would
be there. He was dealing with not only the Yard,
which was too solicitous for his welfare, but also
with a determined clique that had already attempted
to obtain the key to the cipher. Dutch Gus had
searched for Saidee Isaacs and had found her house
in Richmond Hill. The German crook, or one of his
gang, had held the trail—even to London Bridge
Station. Fay felt gripped in the skeins of an enterprise
which might have almost any conclusion.</p>
<p>He was not surprised to see the tail-light and then
the polished tonneau of the little, black motor where
it stood before the station. He crossed the street and
stared at the driver. He went on and into the train shed.</p>
<p>A youthful-appearing figure in a long tan coat and
green hat passed him, stooped, fingered the top button
of a fawn-colored spat and said tersely:</p>
<p>“Carry high, Chester. There’s your man over by
the booking office. Look out for Dutch Gus and
remember your promise.”</p>
<p>Fay set down his black bag, grasped the lapels of
his tweed coat and coughed to hide his astonishment.</p>
<p>The figure in the tan coat was Saidee Isaacs. She
finished with the spat, straightened, twinkled over the
floor and darted out toward the motor car.</p>
<p>MacKeenon worked through the waiting passengers
and touched Fay on the arm.</p>
<p>“This way, mon,” he said. “Ye are punctual.”</p>
<p>Fay was still staring at the doorway through which
<!-- 097.png-->
Saidee Isaacs had vanished. He turned and picked
up the bag. He glanced at the inspector’s long
face. Upon it was written a sly satisfaction that
one sees on old dogs that have cornered their quarry.</p>
<p>“The siller greyhound?” said MacKeenon dryly as
Fay followed him out to the waiting boat train.</p>
<p>“It’s in my pocket.”</p>
<p>“Put it on, mon. It’ll carry ye far.”</p>
<p>Fay set down the bag, reached in his right trousers
pocket and brought forth the insignia of the King’s
couriers. He pinned it in place upon his left lapel
and covered it with his overcoat.</p>
<p>The station-master approached the inspector and
indicated that the train was about to pull out.</p>
<p>MacKeenon held up two fingers and smiled. The
station-master nodded at the secret signal. Fay felt
clutched in the swing of events. He watched the
Scotch detective anxiously.</p>
<p>“Weil, mon,” said MacKeenon, “ye’re off. Here’s
your ticket for the boat to—where ye’re going.
Here’s twa envelopes. Guard them well. There’s
money in one—there’s Sir Richard’s instructions in
th’ other.”</p>
<p>Fay reached, took the envelopes and the ticket, and
crammed them in his inner coat pocket.</p>
<p>“How about getting through at Dover?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Shew th’ siller greyhound, lad. They will ask ye
no questions at all. Many’s the time A’ve done it.”</p>
<p>Fay glanced at the train. The semaphore ahead was
set for “go.” The steam plumed from the engine and
merged with the fog at the end of the shed.
<!-- 098.png--></p>
<p>A bell rang as he thrust a cold finger out to
MacKeenon, clutched the little black bag and sprang
for the running-board of a first-class compartment.
The train started, stopped, then lunged on through
the clammy shed. Fay opened a door, tossed in his
bag and stumbled aboard. He overlooked one trifle.</p>
<p>MacKeenon had drawn a white handkerchief from
his coat pocket—where it was most conveniently
handy—and had shown all the evidences of a man
doubled up with Spanish influenza.</p>
<p>A little Scot—with a bundle and a hacking cough—passed
the inspector and clutched wildly for a handrail
on the car behind the first-class one. He hung
there by grim strength, and finally succeeded in getting
inside a compartment as the train roared out of the
station shed and started to tunnel the murky night.</p>
<p>The inspector’s smile was that of a sly gray fox as
he turned and hurried from the station. He crossed
the bridge on a swift run, barked a surly order to the
waiting driver of a two-wheeler, and settled back as
the whip cracked smartly over the haunches of a
perfectly good horse of the better order.</p>
<p>The driver knew his book. He drove northward
and deposited MacKeenon at Liverpool Street Station,
where a train was waiting by which a number of British
North Sea ports could be reached.</p>
<p>Although he had overlooked it, Fay had company
going to a certain neutral country, and company coming
by a roundabout route.

<h2 title="VII. Passengers for Holland" id="chVII">

</h2>
<p>The channel boat <i>Flushing</i> was waiting the boat
train that left London Bridge Station at eight <span class="sc">P.M.</span>
The grizzled skipper leaned from the bridge and
watched the queue of travelers wind slowly along the
quay, disappear into a little house and emerge somewhat
ruffled in feelings.</p>
<p>A few of these travelers were turned back. One,
at least, was bundled into a closed van, which climbed
the hill and was swallowed by the night mist. This
van bore the magic legend “H.M.S.” on its barred
sides.</p>
<p>Fay had some misgivings concerning the inspection
he expected at the small house on the quay. He had
not yet learned the value of the little silver greyhound
which he wore in his left lapel. The protesting commercial
traveler, who had shared the first-class compartment
on the train coming down, had some difficulty
in convincing three sage-faced men in the small
house that he was merely bound to Holland in the
interests of a Brixton firm that manufactured electrical
goods.</p>
<p>The traveler was passed finally. He went through
the door and hurried up the gangplank to the waiting
<i>Flushing</i>. The three serious men turned and glanced
<!-- 100.png-->
at Fay, who stood with the corner of his coat turned
down and the silver greyhound showing slightly.</p>
<p>Each inspector stared keenly, first at Fay and then
at the black bag he carried. Each lifted a hand and
covered a chin. Each bowed as the hands dropped
and motioned toward the door through which the
electrical salesman had fled precipitately.</p>
<p>“A King’s courier!” Fay heard one say. “I wonder
who’ll be next.”</p>
<p>The next to enter the dingy house on the quay was
the Scot who had sprung aboard the boat train after
being signaled by MacKeenon. He was passed after
he had opened his overcoat, his coat, and had thrust
a wrinkled thumb under a suspender strap, pinned
upon which was a gold insignia that was graven with
two letters, “M.P.”</p>
<p>“Gold follows silver, tonight,” said one of the inspectors.
“There is something going to happen in
Holland.”</p>
<p>The boat cast off from the quay and, clearing the
buoys, struck through the murk on the long leg to the
Continent. A winding shroud came down the sea
and blotted out every light. A moaning lifted from
the waves. Above this moaning sounded the steady
clanking of the Clyde-built engines which were of
four-expansions and balanced.</p>
<p>Knot by knot, league over league, the fast boat cut
through the night. The grizzled skipper placed his
trust in providence and held his North Sea course,
edging as the hours went on toward the Lowland
Country.
<!-- 101.png--></p>
<p>Fay had secured a mid-ship cabin, locked the door
behind the black bag, and emerged to the rail which
was lined with passengers suffering from choppy seas
and lunging gyrations calculated to upset the staunchest
stomach.</p>
<p>He fished in his vest pocket, drew forth a black cigar
which the electrical salesman had given to him on the
train, and lighted it by a scratch of a match on the
sole of his shoe.</p>
<p>It glowed, and cast his face in a ruddy prominence.
A little old man, with a bundle, shrank against a ventilator
and tried to merge with its shadow. Fay noticed
this motion but saw no relation between it and his
mission.</p>
<p>A touch on his arm denoted the commercial traveler
who had been searching the ship for a companion.</p>
<p>“Muddy night,” he said, glancing at his own cigar.
“Beastly wet for my samples, which I hope are below.”</p>
<p>Fay nodded. He drew down his cap, removed the
cigar from his mouth, flecked off the gray ash, and
studied the glowing end.</p>
<p>“Holland,” he asked, “is over there?” The cigar
pointed like a pistol toward the starboard bow. It
swung a point and steadied. It recoiled back into
Fay’s mouth.</p>
<p>“Over there, yes,” said the commercial traveler.
“We’ll dock at sun-up, if there is going to be a sun on
this murky morning.”</p>
<p>Fay glanced at the man. A question revolved and
took form as he waited for the boat to resume an
even keel. “This new war?” he asked, “this
<!-- 102.png-->
commercial thing which has come up? They say it’s going
to be a whale of a task, for England.”</p>
<p>The salesman, whose samples consisted of a line of
motors and rheostats, had been led straight upon his
pet hobby. He was the forerunner of the horde who
were to bring about the final triumph of the Allies over
the <i>Mittel</i> nations. His companions swarmed in
Mesopotamia, in Palestine, in Siberia, in the Balkans,
and in the old markets of Holland and the North
Countries.</p>
<p>He started upon a well-memorized line of sales talk,
which, to Fay, was enlightening but hardly to the
point he was after.</p>
<p>“A moment,” Fay said. “It has just come to me,
sir, that I heard a chap in the West End say something
about the dye industry. Is it so fearfully important?
Has Germany the monopoly? I rather
thought they were making the stuff in England and
the States.”</p>
<p>“Cost too much!” declared the commercial traveler.
“You see, an old dog still has his tricks. There’s
danger that the old dog, and I mean Germany, will
come into her own again in the dye industry. She
had the monopoly once, and she is liable to get it
again.”</p>
<p>Fay studied the cold end of his cigar. He waited
for the man to warm to the subject.</p>
<p>The commercial traveler drew his cravenette coat-collar
up to his eyes and pointed astern and over the
rocking taffrail of the Channel boat.</p>
<p>“The Island, there,” he said in the voice of pounds,
<!-- 103.png-->
shillings and pence, “is recovering from one struggle
and plunging into another. The cheap labor of Germany
and Russia must have an outlet. This outlet, in dye-stuffs
particularly, is threatening to flood the market.
You say that the tariff protects England and the
States. I say that the tariff does not! There are the
foreign markets, open to Germany, without which no
industry can flourish. What of South America and
Africa and the velvet of the trade? Open to the
Germans as well as to us!”</p>
<p>Fay watched the man’s face as he asked quickly:</p>
<p>“This dye monopoly! Is it because of secret formulae
which England has not been able to work out?”</p>
<p>“The nail on the head! The Germans have had
five thousand chemists working on coal tar products
for twenty years. They redoubled their efforts over
the years of the war. They are ready to flood the
dye markets and put out of business every dye maker
in the world, save German. You see what that means.”</p>
<p>Fay turned and stared aft. “So the poor crawlers
on that Island are face to face with the problem of
finding the secrets of the dye industry?” he inquired.</p>
<p>“Oh, if they had all the formulae they could bankrupt
the German game! I heard that secrets were brought
through Switzerland. I never learned of anything
coming of them. Sort of stalemated there! I suppose
the Foreign Office was hoaxed.”</p>
<p>“Most likely,” said Fay, fearing to go further in the
matter. “I did hear something to that effect. Too
bad!”</p>
<p>The traveler clutched the rail and waited for the
<!-- 104.png-->
boat to finish twisting on a downward lunge which
followed the general outlines of a corkscrew. Fay
glided off and forward. He stood in a shadow beneath
the damp ladder that led upward to the wheel-house
and chart-room. He grasped a stay and peered beyond
the green glow which was thrown outward from a faint
starboard light.</p>
<p>The wall of yellowish fog toward which they were
ever steaming rested upon long oily rollers which were
crossed by smaller waves. The North Sea gave forth a
hollow sound as from some vast space. The hiss of
their swift passage was like yeast in process of
fermenting.</p>
<p>Clutched in the onward surge of the passage, he
reviewed the words of the commercial traveler. There
was food for thought in them. The great game to
play concerned the destiny of a vast industry. Briefly,
Germany was about ready to ruin the dye enterprises
of the States and England. The matter hung on the
thin thread of the cipher which Sir Richard had shown
to him in that dingy house near the Embankment.</p>
<p>That, solved, would place the entire world on an
equality. The little dye works could compete with
the larger. The formulae would be open to any man.
The galling monopoly, to come, would be removed.
It all lay in that safe in Holland toward which the
“fast” boat was steaming.</p>
<p>Fay stared at the yellow curtain and dug deep within
his brain. It was possible to double back on his trail,
soon after landing, and make for Scotland. From
there he could take steamer to the States. It was
<!-- 105.png-->
also possible to work by little-known lines through
Stavanger and the northern cities. The Yard had no
call upon him save a personal appeal.</p>
<p>Freedom of action had broadened his thoughts. He
no longer was the numbered thing in the stony coffin
at Dartmoor. He breathed, and lived and had some
right to the good things of this life.</p>
<p>Unclasping his hand from the stay, he turned and
glanced along the deck. It was lined with passengers
who huddled against the rail—shapeless masses of
brown and gray and glistening waterproof.</p>
<p>The commercial traveler had met with a kindred
soul in the person of the little Scot with a bundle.
Their voices sounded above the roar of the swift passage.
The Scot was, in his cunning way, pumping the
traveler dry as to what he had said to Fay.</p>
<p>Fay turned a shoulder to them and started forward
beyond the break of the pilot and chart house. He
heard voices raised in the smoking-room. Pressing
his face to the forward midship port-hole, he wiped
the mist from the glass and peered in.</p>
<p>Three men sat about a table upon which was a
scattering of silver and gold. At their elbows glasses
perched. In their hands were cards. They swung with
the ship, lunged toward each other, and straightened
like dummies in a pantomime. They played their
hands, and redealt. Fay realized that a game of
American stud was going on. He wiped the port-glass
and studied the three faces.</p>
<p>One was cockney with a great arching nose and a
loose catfish mouth. He wore a green cravat and a
<!-- 106.png-->
horsey pin. The second player was stout and triple
chinned. He might have been a Yorkshire horseman
going across for Holland mares. The third player,
whose face was almost hidden by the back of his
head, interested Fay. There was that in the poise of
the man which brought back deep-sea memories when
certain cliques haunted the smoking-rooms of five-day
boats.</p>
<p>This man wore a pair of smoked glasses.</p>
<p>Fay watched the tide of fortune through the port-hole.
It was evident that between the striking of the ship’s
bell for three <span class="sc">A.M.</span> and three-thirty <span class="sc">A.M.</span>—six strokes
and seven—the man with the glasses had increased
his pile of gold at the expense of the Yorkshire squire.</p>
<p>Keen-brained and trained to note appearances, Fay
realized that the man with the glasses had some percentage
upon the game. He searched his memory for
the man’s name. That head and the narrow sloping
shoulders were more than familiar. He decided to
enter the smoking-room.</p>
<p>Rounding the bay of the break of the pilot-house and
chart-room, and passing under the dripping staunchions
of the bridge, he clasped the handle of a sliding door
and pressed firmly.</p>
<p>A gust of mist and briny air drove through the
welcome opening. Fay entered and closed the door.
He moved, not too swiftly, toward a lounge where he
could overlook the players, pressed a button on the
cabin furnishing, and threw open his coat with a relieved
motion as he sat down.</p>
<p>An under-steward came from aft and stared about
<!-- 107.png-->
the room. Fay leaned over a little table, whispered
“hot Scotch” and rubbed his hands from which the
oakum stains had almost been effaced.</p>
<p>He turned then, and stared point-blankly at the
players. The man with the glasses faced him. There
was a scar on the chin. There was a firm set to the
mouth. There was that which told of a young man
who had the oldest face in the world. It was Broadway-trained
and set to the wise leer of an international
swindler.</p>
<p>“Um,” thought Fay, crossing his leg and intensifying
his stare. “Ump!” he added under his breath. “That’s
an old friend—Ace-in-the-hole Harry. No wonder
the poor squire is being trimmed.”</p>
<p>Fay shot a final glance and turned toward the under-steward,
who held the Scotch on a silver tray.</p>
<p>Taking the drink, he passed over a shilling and a
sixpence, set the glass down, and started making tiny
circles on the table with his finger nail.</p>
<p>“Last time I saw him,” he reflected, “was at
‘Jimmy’s.’ Time before that, was in Cairo—at
Shepherd’s. And the time before Shepherd’s was
on a Cape boat—the <i>Kenilworth Castle</i>—where he
was trimming gulls by the ancient and honorable game
of dealing seconds.”</p>
<p>Fay divined with professional intuition that the
fish-mouthed cockney was Harry’s partner, although
their voices were raised in angry recriminations.</p>
<p>He sipped at the Scotch, then rose and watched the
game from a leaning position at the end of the lounge.
The sharper dealt without apparent manipulation. His
<!-- 108.png-->
hands spread over the card, lifted a corner, then reached
for the deck as the Yorkshire squire tossed a sovereign
upon the table.</p>
<p>Fay watched the deal. The light was glaring. The
eyes behind the smoked glasses flashed, then centered
on the gold piece. The game went on with more gold
entering the pot. The show-down, where the sharper
won, revealed the fact that the Yorkshire squire had
a queen in the hole and the dealer had a king. It was
that close!</p>
<p>Fay felt inclined to whistle. He was interested
enough to watch other deals which all seemed set and
regular. Ace-in-the-hole Harry had solved mind-reading,
concluded the cracksman, as he sat down on
the lounge and revolved the problem in his mind.</p>
<p>The game closed suddenly. The Yorkshire squire
rose, glared at the two players, then stamped out
through the door and went aft with a string of oaths
falling behind him, like chips from a whittler.</p>
<p>“May gol blyme!” said the cockney. “’E’s a rum
cove. We cawn’t always win, y’know.”</p>
<p>Harry with the long pseudonym removed his
smoked glasses and stared at Fay.</p>
<p>“A bit o’ deck would help us out,” he said coldly.
“I’m wondering if we make the connecting boat at
Stavanger?”</p>
<p>Fay glanced at his hot Scotch and lifted it as the
two men strode toward the door, through which
they passed to the deck.</p>
<p>He allowed the thin shadow of a smile to cross his
lips. He turned and caught a reflection of himself in
<!-- 109.png-->
a long mirror. He studied this object with concern.
The flight of time, since last he had seen the cardsharper,
had wrought many changes in his appearance.
He was keener-faced and firmer of mouth. The silver-gray
hair at his temples was unnatural and gave him
a youthful appearance due to contrast.</p>
<p>“Stavanger,” he said upending the glass and feeling
the warmth of the liquor. “I’ll remember that. Few
Greeks go to that port. I wonder why he’s going
there?”</p>
<p>“Greeks,” in the argot of the underworld, were
cardsharpers and sure-thing manipulators. Fay
despised their profession. He had an abiding belief
that a man had not lost all honor who would take a
strong-box or a long chance. There had been no
chance in the sharper’s game. The meanest thief in
the world, to him, was the professional gambler.</p>
<p>He rose and closed his tweed coat with a quick
motion. The ship’s bell had struck two times, spaced
close together. It was five o’clock. The Lowland
Country must soon appear through the fog.</p>
<p>It came to him, as he stepped to the dark deck,
that the one change in the sharper’s make-up was the
smoked glasses. They were incongruous and beetle-appearing.
They struck a false note in a card game.
Fay felt dimly that there was a good reason for wearing
them. He sensed a mystery there. He revolved
the matter in his mind and searched the deck for the
two. They had disappeared into a cabin. Most probably
they were dividing the wool shorn from the
Yorkshire lamb.
<!-- 110.png--></p>
<p>A bo’swain, in sou’wester and oilskins, was heaving
the lead from the starboard chains of the foremast
standing-rigging. He called the fathoms with monotonous
regularity. “By the deep, four,” rolled
along the ship. A bell clanged. A jingle sounded. The
screw thrashed as the helm was ported. A stumpy
man, in smug pea-jacket, came out of the pilot-house,
and grasping a funnel stay, leaned far forward. He
searched the yellow fog which drifted athwart the
bow. He whipped out a pair of twelve-diameter glasses
and focused them with his right thumb.</p>
<p>He turned his head, lowered the glasses and pointed
toward a green buoy which was passed close to starboard.
This buoy bore the number “9” on its side.
The wheelman put up the wheel three spokes, then
steadied the ship. She groped on with careful
searching until a mud spit ran beneath the fog curtain
and headed their course.</p>
<p>“Up more,” said the man in the pea-jacket. “Hard
up!” he snapped with British vim. “All the way up,
you!”</p>
<p>The ship sheered like a frightened sow and lay
broadside to the spit. The screw thrashed. They
wore around the point and started clamping down
a fog-shrouded channel which was lined with green
buoys and gas flares.</p>
<p>The scent of fish and lowland marshes came over the
water. The clank of a hidden windmill sounded close
to port. One gaunt arm pierced through the veil and
then was gone. The way ahead opened and revealed
a vista of smacks and crude wooden schooners. The
<!-- 111.png-->
veil dropped upon a scene that Rembrandt would
have fancied. Fay turned away and started toward
his cabin. They were reaching port. The passage
from Dover had been made without accident. It had
been through a sea that had been stained red by the
blood of British seamen.</p>
<p>Sounds of commerce were on every hand as the
<i>Flushing</i> bulled the air with her Mersey-built siren.
She glided over oily backwater and came to a scant
headway before the outlines of a high quay which was
half-revealed in the yellow light of lowland dawn.</p>
<p>Fay opened his door, stepped into the midship-cabin
and sat down on his unused bunk. He closed
his eyes and reviewed the events of the passage. He
made note of a number of things which might have
bearing on the cipher quest. The commercial traveler
had rounded out the importance of the information
Scotland Yard had sent him to obtain. This man from
Brixton was a forerunner in the great commercial war
which was girding the world. He was a scout and an
outpost. After him would come a horde of others.
Devastated Belgium, Northern France and depleted
Holland and Germany were open markets. They
had been glutted by the Great Struggle. They were
like stores from the shelves of which all staple goods
had been swept.</p>
<p>The second event of the voyage, in meeting with the
deep-sea Greek, had a different bearing on the quest.
Fay realized, as he dropped his head in his hands, that
a pull had come which was strong as desire, and sweet
with freedom. Stavanger, where the sharper was going
<!-- 112.png-->
with his cockney foil, was a port out of which many
ships sailed and steamed. From Stavanger it would
be possible to shake the Yard and the runners of
New Victoria Street. Liberty in every action was
possible if he would hasten to the northern port before
the Yard was aware of his dereliction. And liberty
was a tempting morsel to hold before a prisoner on
parole.</p>
<p>Fay lifted his eyes and stared at the sheathing of
his narrow cabin. The ship had reached the quay.
The passengers were crowded forward where they
expected the gangway to be thrust aboard. Their
voices, cosmopolitan mingled, broke through the
silence of the mid-ship stateroom.</p>
<p>A grating sounded along the boat’s planks. A
shudder passed from fore to aft. The siren blared
three short signals. A call came across the water.
Light, from a mist-hidden sun, illumined the port-hole
over Fay’s bunk. He glanced at this evidence of
day.</p>
<p>Bending suddenly, he reached and lifted the little
black bag. The tools clinked slightly. He inserted a
key and glanced at them. They were such as any
doctor of surgery might have carried. There was not
a particle of incriminating evidence in the bag. Fay
rose, lifted a towel from a rack, glanced at its corners
to assure himself that there was no marking to show
from whence it came, then swiftly bound and wrapped
the instruments so that they gave forth no sound as
he dropped the bag to the stateroom’s deck.</p>
<p>He searched through his pockets. The money in
<!-- 113.png-->
his right-hand pocket, the cigarette case, the automatic
revolver on his hip, all were inspected. Replacing
these, he drew out the two envelopes MacKeenon had
passed to him at London Bridge Station.</p>
<p>The first contained one hundred pounds in Bank of
England notes. These were folded lengthwise. They
were crinkling new and sweet to the touch. He
pocketed them and tore the edge of the second envelope.
Its contents caused him to furrow his brow.</p>
<p>The note it contained was from Sir Richard. It
read:</p>
<div style="margin:0.5em 2em">
<p>“S. I. informs me, via phone, that D. G. tailed
you from her house, going south. She saw him pass
from upper window. Govern yourself accordingly.
Get wise, F., and don’t overlook the trifles.</p>
<div style="text-align:right">Your Masked Friend.”</div>
</div>
<p>Fay read the note twice before he laid it in the
wash-bowl and touched a match to its edge. He
breathed tensely as he waited for the smoke to clear
from the stateroom. It was all too evident that Sir
Richard and the girl were hand in glove in the cipher
matter.</p>
<p>There was that in the note which spoke for itself.
Fay felt that it had been written more for the effect
it would have on his loyalty than for the information
it contained. Besides, after all, Dutch Gus had given
up tailing him and had waited until Saidee left the
house in her black motor.</p>
<p>Fay lifted his cap, brushed back his hair, turned on
the water and washed the ashes of the note down
through the drain, then seized the black bag and
<!-- 114.png-->
hurried through the stateroom door. His trail was a
clean one. There was no evidence of his intentions,
one way or the other, upon the North Sea boat.</p>
<p>He worked forward between protesting lines of
waiting passengers. He reached the ladder which led
up to the wheel-house and chart-room. There, grouped
against the bay of the smoking-room, he saw the
cardsharper—sans glasses and sans his wooden
stare. Beyond the “Greek,” as a man apart, stood
the racy-looking cockney in a great tan coat, trimmed
with coster buttons. Their luggage was also separated.
This final touch was for the benefit of the
gulls and pigeons they had trimmed on the passage
over.</p>
<p>Fay swung and stared over the low housetops of
the city. Smoke drifted across the quay and wreathed
the deck-staunchions. Heavy guttural voices echoed
from the pile-strewn shore. A curious crowd of Lowlanders
stood on the edge of the dock and stared toward
the ship. Among them were dogs and well-matured
children.</p>
<p>“All ashore!” called the skipper from a ledge before
the wheel-house. “Line this way and pass the inspectors.
All bags and luggage will be opened.”</p>
<p>Fay pressed back the lapel of his tweed coat and
exposed the little silver greyhound as he stepped
upon the gangplank. He felt a pressure on his back
as he worked slowly up the crowded incline. He
reached the funnel of the outlet—a roped-in bay
where stood two Dutch custom inspectors, their
broad faces gleaming with good humor and badinage.
<!-- 115.png-->
Behind them leaned a man with an old pipe. This
pipe turned and dropped its ashes as Fay pressed
forward the insignia by holding out the lapel of his
coat with a steady thumb.</p>
<p>The custom inspectors turned to the man with the
pipe. They asked a question in Dutch.</p>
<p>The man tilted his pipe upward with a sudden twist
of his wrist and said very distinctly:</p>
<p>“By all means pass him! Never mind the bag!”</p>
<p>Fay stepped ashore. He turned to see who had
been pressing against his back. He overlooked the
trifle! A little old Scot, with a bundle, had already
scurried behind a shed from which he peered with
ferret-like intentness.

<h2 title="VIII. Lurking Shadows" id="chVIII">
<span style="font-size:1.2em;">CHAPTER VIII</span><br><span style="font-size:1.1em">LURKING SHADOWS</span>
</h2>
<p>A sanguine sun broke through the Holland mists
as Fay strode briskly from the docks and quays and
entered the ancient city.</p>
<p>He took the first street which would lead him in the
direction of a little hotel, at one time patronized by
international celebrities of the underworld.</p>
<p>This hotel had fallen upon better days. The paint
and woodwork about the door were new. A smug
respectability beamed from the windows and out of
the courtyard. A motor car, sans rubber tires, stood
within this courtyard. It had been made in Germany
before the war. It was still doing service for the
Dutch proprietor.</p>
<p>Fay stood across the narrow street, set his bag at
his feet and studied the hotel from a score of angles.
He could cross the wide Dutch cobbles and register.
It was most certain that the police would have his
name, native country, and prospective business within
the time it would take to attend to such matters.</p>
<p>He glanced about with the ranging eye of a tourist
who would go on. The street and two narrow mews
or lanes echoed and reëchoed with the clank of wooden
sabots, the squeak of poorly oiled wagon axles, and
the voices of market people who were streaming
toward the quays and the canals.
<!-- 117.png--></p>
<p>Fay studied the situation and decided there was
nothing to be gained by waiting. He knew of no
other hotel in the city. It would serve as a lodging
for the day and the night. It was clean, quiet and
somewhat out of the beaten track of those who administered
the laws in that quaint lowland capital.</p>
<p>There is that in the super-cracksman which is close
to the actor. Fay played his part to perfection as
he finished his stare toward the hotel, reached down
and lifted the bag and crossed the street at a brisk
walk.</p>
<p>He banged the door open like a British traveler
who had been to the continent before. He advanced
to a tiny opening in a side wall, set down his bag and
called for the <i>Hôtelier</i>.</p>
<p>The broad face of the <i>Maître d’Hôtel</i> was thrust
through this opening like a harvest moon in sight of
plenty.</p>
<p>“A room!” said Fay incisively. “Something for a
day or two. I came on the <i>Flushing</i>. I’ll never go
back on that damn boat, sir! It’s an outrage—the
North Sea service!”</p>
<p>The proprietor was impressed. He knew that all
Englishmen swore. Some swore more than others. He
put down Fay’s name—which he gave as “Dr. Crutcher
of London”—his vocation—which was stated to be
“a doctor”—and his probable stay in Holland as
“less than a fortnight.”</p>
<p>Fay followed a maid up to a second floor back room
which overlooked the courtyard and the steel-tired
German car. He closed the door, tried to lock it,
<!-- 118.png-->
then moved over a chair and pressed the top rung up
and under the knob.</p>
<p>He removed his coat, tossed his cap on the floor and
lay back on the bed with the thumb and forefinger of
his right hand pressing against his eyeballs.</p>
<p>He had much to do and little time to do it in. He
reviewed the trip to Holland. It was a wild project,
if ever there was one. The only real thing in the entire
matter was the crinkling Bank of England notes in his
pockets and the knowledge that he was free to pass
the door which led from his room. He rose swiftly,
crossed the floor, and pulled away the chair. The binding
bars of Dartmoor were still about him. The constriction
of closed places got on his nerves.</p>
<p>He summed the situation up as he stood behind a
lace curtain and stared at the courtyard. His keen,
gray-crowned head was poised like a quick bird as the
events of the two days flashed over his brain.</p>
<p>From the moment of his release he had been haunted
by the thought of shadows. They reached and groped
for him despite every effort he had made to throw them
off. He knew of the wide-flung power of Scotland
Yard. It never let a man go!</p>
<p>Then, for what reason, he argued, had they let him
run scot-free? Had a net already been spread into
which he was bound to stumble? Or was it the flicker
of fortune’s wheel that had turned his way at last?</p>
<p>He examined the lock of the little black bag, reached
for his cap and overcoat, and strode out of the room.
The yielding door was so unlike the iron horror at
Dartmoor! He whistled gayly as he ran down the
<!-- 119.png-->
ancient steps and burst out and into the glad light of
day.</p>
<p>The actor in him came to the fore. He thought the
part he was playing. It was no matter of studied
gestures and halting steps. He was English of the
English! He strode into the town’s better part with
the step of a conqueror. He looked the British tourist
to perfection. His plaid cap, his well-fitting overcoat,
his square-toed shoes were his passport.</p>
<p>He modified his walk to a saunter. His eyes fixed
upon nothing in general, but they saw everything with
that vividness which is given to prisoners on parole and
those who have been denied the wine of life and living.</p>
<p>The feeling still remained within him that somewhere
in that stolid-faced crowd a shadow lurked. It was
the same sinister hand which had come out with him
through the guarded gates of Dartmoor. It was the
long arm of the Yard, reaching, reaching. He felt its
fingers and turned swiftly. He went on. No one of
all that throng showed a familiar face.</p>
<p>He retraced his steps by rounding a square and doubling
back almost to the little hotel. He searched each
figure, in passing. He saw few English in that throng.</p>
<p>Spies, commercial agents of the seven governments,
oversea soldiers on furlough, interned or invalided
troops—the backwash and the riffraff of a war that
was over—filled the ancient streets.</p>
<p>He threw off the feeling of being shadowed, and took
the shady side of a broad avenue. It would lead him
past the embassy wherein was the strong-box and the
key to the dye cipher.
<!-- 120.png--></p>
<p>More bold, now, and decidedly English, he advanced
with head thrown back, and that keen smile upon his
lips which brought answering warmth from the
passers-by.</p>
<p>It was nice to be alive upon that glad day. The
bright sun had doubled its grandeur when freed from
the grip of the morning fog. The long lines of trees,
the well-clipped hedges, and the rare bulbs of Holland
were out in their spring clothing.</p>
<p>“Gad!” said Fay to himself. “This is living!”</p>
<p>He drew out his cigarette-case, removed a cigarette,
tapped it on the palm of his hand and struck a match
with a quick jerk of his heel. It came to him, as he inhaled
the rich Turkish fumes, that the action of lighting
a match on his heel was foreign to the country of Holland
and even to the English. It was a flaw in his
disguise!</p>
<p>“Trifles!” he said, half aloud. “That was a slip.
I must be careful.”</p>
<p>He went on and crossed the avenue at the square
below the embassy. He drank in its details as he
passed along. He photographed the front so that he
could have made a drawing of every detail—the long
windows, the high marble steps, the flunky in purple
and knee-breeches, the insignia near the great door,
the semi-basement with its iron-grilled apertures.</p>
<p>A crossing above the embassy’s building drew him
back over the avenue and down through the low houses
of a side street. He found a passage that passed parallel
to the brick barrier which fenced in the ambassador’s
grounds. He estimated the height of this wall as he
<!-- 121.png-->
hurried by it. He turned the corner, and bounded the
building as he glided out into the avenue and retraced
his steps toward the hotel. He now had a plan of the
project. It looked like clear sailing in the night to
come.</p>
<p>A back glance, as he lighted a cigarette by striking
the match upon a stone, showed a figure descending
the embassy’s steps and limping in his direction. He
waited and dragged at the cigarette. The man who
passed was English. He had been through the war.</p>
<p>“I say,” said Fay, hurrying after the cripple. “Would
you mind putting a chap straight? Is that the Hôtel
de Ville?”</p>
<p>Fay pointed his cigarette at the embassy building
as the soldier turned.</p>
<p>“Is it?” he repeated. “I hope I haven’t troubled
you.”</p>
<p>“Blyme no!” answered the Tommy. “Hit’s the
royal muckers wot do a man dirt, it his! Neutral
embassy, wot? Wot satisfaction his there in that?
Says I, to myself, I’ll look up my brother ’Arry who was
lost at Wipers. Took by the Germans, ’e was! They
told me to go to Switzerland, they did. ’Ow ham I
goin’ to Switzerland on three bob, six?”</p>
<p>Fay fell into stride with the soldier, and walked at
least five squares with him. He twisted the conversation
around from ’Arry to a general outline of the floor
plan of the embassy and the number of guards. He
left his man near the British embassy. The two
sovereigns he pressed into a protesting palm were well
earned, although the cockney was unaware of it.
<!-- 122.png--></p>
<p>“Hope you find ’Arry,” said the cracksman, hurrying
toward the hotel.</p>
<p>The information he had gained coincided, in the
main, with the diagram which Saidee Isaacs had given
to him. The additional details of the day guards, and
the disposition of the embassy clerks, were sufficient to
lay out the entire plan of action.</p>
<p>Fay wasted no time. He reached the hotel, called
for mail which he knew he did not have, then hurried
upstairs and entered his room. He emptied the black
bag of its contents, placed the surgical tools about his
pockets and under his vest so that they would not
bulge, then examined the revolver.</p>
<p>It was loaded. It was a perfect weapon of its kind.
He thrust it in the side-slit of his overcoat where his
hand could reach readily. He rose. It came to him
with sudden force that he had burned his bridges,
save for the little silver greyhound. It would not do
to have this on in case of capture.</p>
<p>His eyes roamed the room. A cake of very thin
soap attracted his attention. Taking this, and pressing
the insignia deep within the edge, he moved to the
window and examined the hiding place. An opening
showed, which he smoothed over by washing his hands
and softening the soap. He tossed the bar behind the
wash-stand where it would never be noticed.</p>
<p>The bag caught his eye as he stepped toward the door.
He returned, picked up a few charred sticks and coals
from the fireplace and dropped them inside the instrument
case. He locked it and tested its weight.
A maid or the Maître d’Hôtel would be satisfied with
<!-- 123.png-->
the substitution providing they did not force the
lock.</p>
<p>“All set,” said Fay with American accent. “When
I come back to this place, it’ll be with the key to the
cipher or handcuffed. The coppers in this burg know
where everybody lives.”</p>
<p>He went down the stairs and out into the street.
This time he did not glance behind as he hurried toward
the center of the city and the railroad station by which
a number of trains could be taken out of the Lowland
country.</p>
<p>It was his intention to ride some little distance
toward the German border, get off the train, and double
back on foot so as to throw off any possible pursuit.</p>
<p>He found a map near the booking-office. The station
was thronged with Germans and commercial travelers
who were expecting the final lifting of the great embargo
against the <i>Mittel</i> nations. England and the
States were cursed in Low Dutch.</p>
<p>Fay made a note of the train time on his cuff with
a tiny lead-pencil. He had over thirty minutes to
catch the first train eastward. He passed through
the station and stood on the curb whereat decrepit
motor cars and thin horses clattered up with passengers.</p>
<p>Suddenly, with the intuition given to the hunted,
he saw a familiar form dodge out of his sight and behind
a corner where the traffic swirled. He acted
swiftly. Crossing the street, he hurried down the
sidewalk and away from the station.</p>
<p>Fay went on with eyes darting to left and right. He
passed an open doorway. In it stood two forms.
<!-- 124.png-->
They had attempted to dodge out of sight, but were
held by outpouring customers of the store where they
had taken refuge.</p>
<p>Fay photographed them on his mind without turning
his head in the slightest. He glided on with swift
steps. A bitter smile crossed his lips as he sprang over
the curb and darted between two vehicles.</p>
<p>One of the two men was MacKeenon! There could
be no doubt of this at all. Fay had caught a side view
of the Scotch inspector. His companion was a little
old man with a bundle.</p>
<p>“And may your own bungling undo you!” Fay exclaimed
as he turned a corner and darted out of sight.
“I’m done,” he added. “I’ll never trust another
copper.”</p>
<p>He was deeply in earnest. The sight of MacKeenon
had stirred every drop of blood in his body. It was
not enough that Sir Richard would send him after the
cipher-key. The oily chief of the Identification Bureau
had seen to it that the bloodhounds of the law went
along in case of a change of heart.</p>
<p>Fay had changed his heart. It was steeled now
against the project. He flashed a plan over his mind
in the time of seconds. He would abandon the quest,
make for the quays, take a boat for the north, and
join the two card swindlers. In this manner the
Yard would be foiled, and the cipher-key could rot in
the safe.</p>
<p>Sir Richard had underestimated his man. Fay had
the memory of five years in that Dartmoor hell to spur
his heels. The chief had stated that he was to go
<!-- 125.png-->
scot-free. The bitterness of this came home to him
at the memory of MacKeenon’s long keen face. The
hollow eyes and sharp features of the inspector—the
gaunt, trained-to-the-last-ounce of energy and cunning
stamped there, was a whip held over the felon.</p>
<p>“Au revoir,” Fay said bitterly, as he dodged and
twisted and turned in his path toward the quays.
“Follow me now if you can, Mac!”</p>
<p>There was no sign behind of pursuit or a shadow.
Fay took every precaution. He approached the quays
and the canals by lowland paths as the sun dipped
below the western sea-mist. He leaped a causeway,
went over a thin plank, and drew this ashore after
him. The way ahead was narrow. The way behind
was closed to all save a good swimmer.</p>
<p>He came to a paved road beside which was a long
row of tall poplars. A windmill with crossed arms,
like two combs on a pepper box, reared toward the sea.
Another showed beyond gray-stucco houses and lean
barns. The flat-green of Holland merged into a pea-soup
fog which was rising.</p>
<p>A rusty steamer of the smaller class lay at a quay.
Drifting smoke poured from her one squat funnel.
The gangplank was down. A stream of stolid Dutch
was mounting this plank. They seemed, in the gloom,
like cattle going to slaughter.</p>
<p>Fay found a boatman who was cleaning fish at the
side of the canal. The cracksman drew his coat around
his thin shoulders and pointed toward the steamer.</p>
<p>“I want to go on that,” he said.</p>
<p>The boatman laid down a fish-knife, tossed a fish
<!-- 126.png-->
into the bottom of the boat, and rose with his scale-clustered
hand to his cap.</p>
<p>“<i>Ein thaler</i>,” he said. “I go with you over there
for <i>ein thaler</i>.”</p>
<p>Fay drew out four silver shillings and handed them
down to the boatman. He sprang to a thwart of
the boat and waited as the fisherman got out two clumsy
oars, cast off the painter and shoved the boat from the
edge of the canal.</p>
<p>“Hurry,” said Fay, muffling his face in the stern of
the boat.</p>
<p>The rower nodded and dipped the oars into the
dark water. The boat glided toward the ship. A
voice called across the canal. Fay rose and stared
back over the course they had come. Muffled shadows
moved on the bank. A match was struck. This went
out and left a flare still burning in his eyes. He
touched the boatman’s shoulder.</p>
<p>“Faster,” he said. “Row faster!”</p>
<p>The boat reached the end of a rotting pier. Fay
stretched his arms upward, grasped a string-piece and
lifted himself to the cross planks.</p>
<p>He did not glance at the boat or the boatman as he
hurried ashore and along the bank of the canal toward
the quay where the ship was taking aboard the cattle-like
passengers. A horn blared the night as he reached
the gangplank.</p>
<p>He was one step advanced up this plank when a
rattle and the thin honk of an auto horn caused him to
turn his head over his shoulder.</p>
<p>The rubberless and decrepit motor car from the hotel
<!-- 127.png-->
thrust a pair of pale lights through the gloom. On
the driver’s seat of this car crouched a chauffeur who
was staring at his steaming radiator.</p>
<p>A woman, with her form hidden by a long coat and
her face masked beneath a broad-brimmed hat, sprang
from the tonneau of the car, said something to the
driver in a low voice and hurried in the direction of
the gangplank.</p>
<p>Fay turned his head completely, grasped the handrail
of the plank, and stared at this woman. Her
figure, even under the coat, was familiar to him. He
frowned slightly, let go his grip on the rail and backed
down to the quay.</p>
<p>“You?” he said almost bitterly as he reached the
woman’s side. “What are you doing here, Saidee?”</p>
<p>“I came after you.” Her face lifted under her hat.
Her eyes were dark and purposeful. The tightening
of her lips drew down the corners of her mouth.</p>
<p>“You came after me. Seems as if everybody’s
coming after me. I’m going to take this boat.”</p>
<p>“No, you’re not! You’re going back, after—”
She half turned and stared over the quay. “You’re
going back after the cipher, Chester,” she said in a
whisper. “You’re the only one who can get it. Come
on with me.” Her gloved fingers pressed lightly on
the sleeve of his coat. Her grip became firmer.
“Please come,” she added hastily. “You haven’t any
time to lose. You’re not going away—for my sake,
Chester.”</p>
<p>He tore loose her grip with an angry jerk. “You,”
he said, “are no better than the others—MacKeenon,
<!-- 128.png-->
that hell-hound, and Sir Richard. Why didn’t you
let me take the trick alone? I didn’t need any help.
Now the job is queered—for good. I’m going to
take this ship!”</p>
<p>“Oh, but Chester, you’re not. Remember your
promise?”</p>
<p>“Promise?”</p>
<p>“Yes—to Inspector MacKeenon and Sir Richard.”</p>
<p>Fay stepped back a foot or more. He stared at the
slight form of Saidee Isaacs as if he would crush her.
His hands raised. His fingers clutched deep within
his palms.</p>
<p>“I remember,” he said evenly, “that they were the
ones who made the promises. They said ‘good by,
good luck and God bless you,’ and sent me on my way,
scot-free, so I thought. Today—tonight—I saw
that hell-hound from the yard—MacKeenon! Then
along you came. Does the world know that I came
here after that crib? Has it been shouted to the
housetops? I’m done!”</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs blazed back with sudden fire. Her
voice raised as she said:</p>
<p>“You’re only on parole! You can’t escape them,
Chester! Please do what they want you to do. Do
what I want you to do. Then everything will come
out right.”</p>
<p>Fay turned his head away and stared toward the
boat. The last passenger was mounting the gangplank.
The shore-lines were being cast off. A plume
of white steam issued from the pipe aft the squat
funnel.
<!-- 129.png--></p>
<p>“I’m off!” he said with final resolution. “I’ll take
the old, old trail—away from you and those hell-hounds.
They can’t catch me if they try.”</p>
<p>“And me?” asked Saidee, with none of her old fire.</p>
<p>“And you can tell them I was with them till they
rounded on me. They know me! A crook has got
to be trusted if you want him to play square. They’ve
shadowed me from London. They’re still sniffing on
my trail. But water breaks it, and Saidee, it’s good-by!”</p>
<p>“Don’t go, Chester. You’ll be sorry.”</p>
<p>Her voice had taken on an open threat. He caught
the note and smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>“You weren’t that way once,” he said, thrusting his
hands in his pockets and drawing his coat about his
knees. “Once, you were a pal. The best pal a fellow
ever had. Now you’re hooked-up with MacKeenon
and Co. You’re working for the Yard. How did you
get that house—that little motor—those clothes?
How did you get them?”</p>
<p>The old fire flamed her eyes. She backed away and
motioned for him to go. Her hand dropped to her
side. She waited.</p>
<p>“Good-by!” he said, turning. “Tell your friends of
the Yard it’s no use looking for me. I’ll be in—”</p>
<p>“Dartmoor in three days!” she exclaimed, walking
toward the decrepit motor car without glancing back.</p>
<p>Fay hesitated the fractional part of a second. He
was of two minds. Saidee had hurt him with her last
thrust. It was like her to say that. It was also a
dare. He took it by swinging, striding for the
<!-- 130.png-->
gangplank and dashing up its slope as two deck hands seized
the handles to draw it aboard.</p>
<p>The propeller throbbed. A hoarse blare awoke the
birds on the bank of the quay. A small group gathered
and watched the ship ware out and take the channel
toward the sea. It clamped down the dark waters
and rounded a point upon which was a blue light.</p>
<p>Fay climbed up the forbidden ladder leading to the
pilot-house. He strained his eyes. The motor car
with its twin cones of white fire was still on the quay.
In the tonneau of this he saw Saidee Isaacs standing.
Her hands were at her sides. Her veil was lifted up and
over the brim of her hat.</p>
<p>Suddenly, with a quick gesture, she drew down the
veil. The car turned clumsily and made for the dark
aisles of the town.</p>
<p>Rolling mist blotted out both shores of the channel.
The ship passed painted buoys from which she sheered
like a frightened sow in a pen. The way ahead was
found by reversing and keeping bare steerage-way.
A projector of yellowish light stabbed from the pilot-house.
This was turned on and off as each buoy was
raised.</p>
<p>Windmills loomed above the low lines of the dykes.
Fishing boats with furled sails and quaint deck-houses
astern swung at anchor. Once the fog lifted sufficiently
to reveal a long road running over a causeway which
stabbed like a white dagger through the night.</p>
<p>Fay descended the ladder and stood in the gloom
of the forward starboard boat which was drawn aboard
and lashed to the davits. He allowed his right
<!-- 131.png-->
hand to coil over the butt of the American automatic.
Its cold chill struck through his body. He was in no
mood to be thwarted by MacKeenon or the Yard. The
bitterness of a vain project distilled black thoughts in
his brain.</p>
<p>He refused to allow himself to think of Saidee Isaacs.
She was gone, and forever, he thought. He steeled
himself against his better judgment. He wanted the
wide places where he would be free from shadows and
reaching hands. Then, and afterwards, he could consider
the entire matter. It had been too soon since
leaving Dartmoor for him to have found himself. He
knew this with the intuition of the released felon. A
man’s mind was a delicate thing. It could not adjust
itself over night or during the period of a few days.
It wanted weeks and months.</p>
<p>A plan took form and substance as he waited by the
boat. He did not even know the ports of call of the
ship he was on. Any question toward finding out
would excite suspicion. The purser would be around
for the fare. Fay wondered, with a light laugh, what
port he would name. Any one would do as a guess
and then if the ship did not touch at that port, he could
explain that a mistake had been made. A fugitive was
safer without a set plan.</p>
<p>A Dutch village was passed to port. The low roofs
of this settlement had scarcely been swallowed by the
mist when Fay felt the ship swing her bow and reverse
the propeller. Bells clanged in the engine-room. A
stolid head appeared through the dark opening of the
pilot-house. Deep-sunken eyes, beneath a cloth cap,
<!-- 132.png-->
stared forward and over the vessel’s bow. A denser
mass showed there. This mass took the form of another
ship which was passing in the night.</p>
<p>Two blasts sounded from the siren aft the squat
funnel. These were answered as both ships hugged the
banks of the canal. They glided by, starboard to port,
with a scant fathom’s distance between the rails.</p>
<p>Fay leaned outboard, grasped a davit-stay and studied
the faces of the passengers on the boat. He ran his
eyes down the line. He felt the answering stares.
Broad faces and keen ones were there. Flashily dressed
travelers were sandwiched between burly burgers.
Children stood on the high places of the crowded deck
with their bow legs supporting grotesque bodies.</p>
<p>It came to Fay, with a pang, that these were refugees
and passengers from England. Some were returning to
the invaded districts of Belgium. Others had been
sent back to claim their own. They were the last wave
receding from the war. They would land at the Lowland
city he had quitted so hastily.</p>
<p>He searched anew for the name of the boat. It had
undoubtedly left a northern British or Scotch port that
morning. The stern passed. Fay leaned further outboard
and squinted his eyes. He made out the name.</p>
<p><i>Harwich of Newcastle.</i></p>
<p>His eyes lifted to the taffrail. A lone figure stood
there. A pair of gleaming eyes flashed over the distance
between the passing ships. A heavy brow was
pulled down by a muscular contraction.</p>
<p>Fay closed his lips in a hard firm line. He drew
himself back and into the shadow of the boat. He
<!-- 133.png-->
peered out from this position until the ship had merged
within the pea-soup fog.</p>
<p>The man at the stern had lived too long. He was
Dutch Gus!</p>
<p>Minutes passed with Fay in the same crouching
position. He had received a facer. There was no
denying the fact that Dutch Gus was alive. That individual
was bound to the Holland port for no good
reason. He had escaped from the Thames and had
come on to settle accounts. Perhaps he was after the
key to the dye cipher.</p>
<p>Fay straightened himself with an effort. He
sauntered around the stern of the life-boat, drew out
his cigarette-case, removed a cigarette, lighted this
with a swift scratch of a match along the rail and went
aft with his eyes searching for a deck steward.</p>
<p>He found one in the doorway of a midship cabin.</p>
<p>“Beastly,” he drawled. “Beastly awkward of me,
wasn’t it?” he added. “I’ve gone and left Holland
without my luggage. Can you tell me where I can
get off this ship?”</p>
<p>The steward pocketed the shilling Fay pressed into
his reaching palm. He pointed toward a darker mass
in the fog.</p>
<p>“There,” he said in heavy English. “There, in
ten minutes, sir. We put in at Swartzburg for any
cargo that may be on the quay.”

<h2 title="IX. Robbery Under Arms" id="chIX">
<span style="font-size:1.2em;">CHAPTER IX</span><br><span style="font-size:1.1em">ROBBERY UNDER ARMS</span>
</h2>
<p>The ship had no sooner touched the dock than Fay
leaped ashore and hurried toward a yellow light which
marked a half-hotel, half-tippling place of doubtful
aspect.</p>
<p>He pressed the door open and glided inside the
single ground-floor room. A group of burgers and
broad-hipped Dutch girls were sitting at the tables.
A Holland maid was bending over the tap to a huge
cask of beer.</p>
<p>She straightened, pressed back her hair and stared
at Fay as if he were a ghost. Her eyes dropped under
his level scrutiny. He turned toward the drinkers.</p>
<p>“Is there a motor car anywhere about this town?”
he asked. “I must have one!” His voice was keen
and demanding.</p>
<p>A German deserter from Hindenburg’s shattered
armies rose, set down a stein, and threw back his head.</p>
<p>“<i>Engländer?</i>” he asked drunkenly. “<i>Du bist ein
Engländer?</i>”</p>
<p>“Worse than that!” declared Fay. “I’m American!
I want a motor car or a fast wagon. I must go back!”
Fay pointed toward the east. He dipped his hand into
his right-hand trousers pocket and brought forth a
palm-full of English shillings and sovereigns.
<!-- 135.png--></p>
<p>“Here, <i>Fräulein</i>,” he said to the girl at the beer-cask.
“Drinks all around. You join me, <i>bitte</i>?”</p>
<p>Fay’s knowledge of German was limited. He knew
no Dutch at all. He labored under the delusion that
the language of the Fatherland would serve for Holland.
The presence of the German soldier had seemed to carry
this out.</p>
<p>The maid’s stupid stare told him that he had not
been understood. He turned toward the German
deserter. It seemed irony that he should use such a
man for the furtherance of his purpose.</p>
<p>“Here, Heinrich,” he said, passing over a gold piece,
“get busy! Drinks all around and then a motor car.
Ask these people if there is one in the burg.”</p>
<p>The German was not too drunk to know the color of
gold. He said something to the girl in Dutch, snatched
up his stein, drained it and hurried out through the
doorway. Fay tasted the bitter beer brought to him
by the maid, lifted his eyes over the edge of the stein
and strained his ears.</p>
<p>A hoarse siren blared the night. The ship was leaving
the quay. The hour was not yet ten. Fay darted
swift glances over the drinkers. He studied a picture
which might have been painted by Rubens or Franz
Hals. A slow fire burned in a great open fireplace.
The crude tables, the broad-faced roisterers, the silent
girls with their long pig-tails and meek eyes held him
until a sound was driven through a quarter-open window.
This sound was the exhaust from an open muffler.
It had an American suggestion in its sharp notes.</p>
<p>Fay carefully avoided the nearest table, bowed to
<!-- 136.png-->
the maid as he drew his coat about his knees, and
pressed open the door. He stood under the front
thatch of the inn. He smiled with quick appreciation
as the round, moon-like discs of two headlamps burned
through the fog, shot off across the Lowland, then
steadied and grew brighter.</p>
<p>“A flivver!” he exclaimed. “By all that’s holy—it’s
from the States.”</p>
<p>A Dutch boy in an impossible make-up of leathern
coat and bright, peaked cap drove up and almost
catapulted the drunken German to the road’s cobbles
as the brake went on with a protesting squeak.</p>
<p>Fay lifted the German soldier from the dashboard
and steadied him on his wobbling legs, where he stood
like a limp mannikin ready to topple over.</p>
<p>The Dutch boy slowed the engine by putting up the
throttle lever, under the wheel. He stared blankly
from Fay to the German.</p>
<p>“All right,” said the cracksman as the door of the
inn opened and let out a mellow light. “I paid him.
I’ll pay you, too, when you land me over there.” Fay
pointed toward the east through the night fog.</p>
<p>The boy twisted the wheel, partly pressed his pedal
and advanced the throttle. The flivver spun and
almost struck the German with the rear mud-guard.
Fay leaped aboard and showed the boy a shining yellow
sovereign in the hollow of his palm.</p>
<p>“Drive like hell!” he said. “I’ll show you the way—along
the canal.”</p>
<p>The soldier shouted something as the tiny car
rattled over the cobbles and darted into the one street
<!-- 137.png-->
of the town. Fay drew his cap down over his eyes and
leaned out. He blinked as he noted the kind of tires
the auto was equipped with. They were sections of
rubber hose bound with wire and rope. They bumped
and clattered. They drove a series of shivers up his
spine.</p>
<p>“England’s embargo!” he groaned.</p>
<p>The Dutch boy pressed the pedal through to second
speed. The car rumbled over a causeway and turned
into a white road which was lined with stem-like trees
of a species Fay had never seen. He held tight to the
bouncing seat and peered through the cracked windshield.
The two searchlights rose and fell with the
engine’s revolutions. One moment the road was dark
and pit-like; the next, the way was clear for a full
hundred yards.</p>
<p>The boy knew his business. This much Fay had
decided. The light car roared with open muffler
through sleeping towns. It swerved at a bend of the
canal and struck off across a dyke-country beyond which
glowed the lights of a city.</p>
<p>Low barns and houses, crowned with the gaunt arms
of silent windmills, flashed by. A shout struck out
from a crossing. The boy went on with his blue eyes
fixed on the road and his hand on the throttle-lever.</p>
<p>Fay dragged out his watch by the chain and attempted
to find the time. He bent down, struck a
match and held it to the crystal. It was close to eleven
o’clock. The fog had lifted from the dyke-land.</p>
<p>A squeak of brakes and the smell of hot oil announced
the first turn leading into the city. Fay rose, after
<!-- 138.png-->
replacing his watch, and stared over the windshield.
He recognized the quays in the distance. He saw the
tall spire of the Hôtel de Ville.</p>
<p>“Right here!” he told the boy as the car stopped.
“You can go back. Take these and buy a set of tires!”</p>
<p>Fay handed over the sovereign capped with a second
one. He shot a keen glance at the driver. The boy
had removed his cap and was bowing with his broad
face distended into a broader smile.</p>
<p>“S’long!” said Fay, hurrying off.</p>
<p>He heard the roar of the engine and the rattle of loose
mud-guards and clattery wheels. He did not glance
back. The time was short. It was some little distance
to the embassy building.</p>
<p>To a man who had prowled the South Kensington
Museum and gotten away with its choicest jade and
jasper—to the first cracksman then living—the
problems of the dye cipher and of opening the embassy’s
safe were not impossible. Fay had taken harder
boxes without leaving a trace. The stethoscope he
carried was twenty times more delicate than the drum
of a human ear. The combination-locks were fitted
with pads, but these would not prevent some slight
sound when the tumblers dropped into their designated
notches. The Hatton Gardens affair had proved the
truth of this.</p>
<p>There was also a little affair in Paris in the old days
before the war. Fay recalled its details as he glided
through the dark streets in the general direction of the
embassy.</p>
<p>Dutch Gus, of dire memory, had boosted him up to
<!-- 139.png-->
a window from an alley. The German crook had
waited outside in the guise of a drunken night-rounder—a
part he often played in real life. Then the German’s
eyes had popped at the sight of swag, loot and
plunder obtained in the time of minutes,—not more
than fifteen.</p>
<p>Fay chuckled at this job which had been so easy.
He had gone through a vault door, a day door and the
steel-ribbed keister by means of a stethoscope. This
enterprise, of course, had been on an ancient French
combination box whose tumblers, to him, were like
piano-keys to a virtuoso.</p>
<p>And now, Sir Richard had picked him as the best
man handy. The chief had cunningly played upon
the heart cords of patriotism without slopping over.
The humor of the situation was its saving point. The
chief had failed by a double-play. Dutch Gus had
appeared from out of the murky waters of the Thames.
Fay knew in the bottom of his heart that the reason
which was urging him on was the old one of jealousy.
The protection of the Yard, the call from Saidee Isaacs,
the honor of the enterprise which might save a world
from a galling monopoly, all were less than the quick
flash of the German crook at the taffrail of the inbound
steamer.</p>
<p>Fay reviewed these things and smiled bitterly. He
nursed no delusions. He was going to take that box
for the reason that a lesser crook and a stool-pigeon
was embarked on the same enterprise. It was hardly
likely that Dutch Gus, and any of his mob he might
have with him, would strike on the first night. He
<!-- 140.png-->
resolved to leave them an empty keister, as far as the
key to the cipher was concerned.</p>
<p>In all the thoughts which flashed through his brain
as he neared the embassy there was none of the right
or the wrong of the matter. No maudlin sympathy
for a fallen felon had ever quite reached his heart.
He was steeled against an ordinary assault from that
direction. The five years at Dartmoor had taught
him caution on a desperate enterprise. Possessed with
superior education and the keen wits of a modern stock
broker or man about town, he regarded crime as the
natural outlet for his energy. It had not paid, but this
had been on account of the trifles. There was the
thumb-print in London which had brought the braying
bloodhounds of the Yard down upon him. There was
a dropped hotel key in Chicago. There was a legion
of mistakes.</p>
<p>He went on cautiously and set his mind on the problem
ahead of him. He was muffled to the eyes. The
tools were safe about his clothes. The American
automatic was in his right-hand coat pocket. Also,
he had not neglected the rubber gloves which were to
protect his fingers. The matter looked promising.
Already the great clock in the Hôtel de Ville had
struck the maximum. It was after twelve!</p>
<p>A light mist swirled through the streets with a promise
of more. He watched it wrap the staid, snug-nested
houses in gossamer folds. A thin troop of stragglers
wound homeward—German merchants out at elbows
since the Great Embargo, roisterers and women in
yellow skirts who had followed the armies until they
<!-- 141.png-->
walked like grenadiers, burgers with pot-bellies and
torches, who took the middle of the streets from force
of habit during the desperate days of the war.</p>
<p>Fay disappeared down through the gloom of a well-remembered
lane, waited a moment, then tiptoed his
way over stones till he reached a narrow alley which
cut between the embassy and a cloth merchant’s
somber exterior. The high-barred windows on both
sides of him were dark and staring.</p>
<p>Glancing back for a final test, Fay reached upward
and waited with his arms extended to their limit. He
narrowed his eyes as objects stood out in the gloom of
the passage.</p>
<p>A skulking form passed the entrance to the alley.
This form had hesitated for the fractional part of a
minute. Then it had disappeared, going in the direction
of the Hôtel de Ville.</p>
<p>A low oath dropped from Fay’s lips. The skulker
might have been a guard to the embassy. Again, it
might have been a drunken roisterer. Whoever it was,
there was danger of detection.</p>
<p>Fay clinched his teeth with much of the old nerve
surging through him, grasped the top of the wall with
his fingers and was up and over like a quick alley cat.</p>
<p>Gripped with the game, he worked swiftly. The
garden wherein he stood was filled with well-trimmed
bushes and the scent of spring blossoms. He crossed
a soft bed by stepping on stones. He stooped at a
low window and tested his weight against the sash.
Rising then, and listening, he drew on a pair of rubber
gloves and curled his fingers.
<!-- 142.png--></p>
<p>The window might be connected with an alarm. He
decided to take no chances. The panes of glass were
large enough for a man to squeeze through. He chose
one at the bottom and rapidly cut through the putty
with the point of a knife. It flaked off and fell at his
feet. The glass came out with a prying attempt at
the upper edge. A breath of moist air greeted him.
He had broken through to the basement of the embassy.</p>
<p>Canting his head, he listened. Hearing nothing, he
thrust an arm through the opening he had made and
worked his body after the arm. His rubber-covered
fingers touched a rug on the floor. He half turned,
squirmed without sound and sat down with his face
toward the window.</p>
<p>He kept this in view as a possible get-away as he
moved over the floor without rising to his feet. A
faint yellowish light marked the outlines of the removed
pane. All else within the basement room was
black.</p>
<p>The ticking of a clock sounded at his right. He
stared in this direction and waited with every sense
alert. It was like receiving a warning of the presence
of life.</p>
<p>He moved on with both hands outstretched. He
reached the edge of the rug. His fingers coiled over
the fringe. Beyond this was polished wood which felt
smooth to the rubber gloves.</p>
<p>Then, suddenly, he became aware of the muffled
breathing of one in torture. Groans sounded in low
agony.</p>
<p>Fay had no light save wax matches. He sensed
<!-- 143.png-->
the general direction of the sounds and moved slowly
in their direction. Every nerve of him was alert.
The heavy drag of the automatic was reassuring. It
could be used at an instant’s notice.</p>
<p>The gasps and groans were nearer now. He reached
out and touched a man’s form. About this form were
many turns of heavy cord. Across the man’s mouth
was a stick held in place behind the ears by a sash.</p>
<p>Fay leaned down and strained his eyes. The yellowish
light from the open pane sifted through the
room. Its details came out like figures on a fogged
photograph-plate.</p>
<p>The man, trussed like a stuffed partridge, moved
both legs and rolled over. Fay saw a pasty countenance
alongside a cap upon which was gold braid.
Purple waves mounted up this man’s neck. The gag
was a clever one.</p>
<p>“The embassy’s night-guard,” said Fay in a whisper.
“Poor chap, I was worried about you all along. Somebody’s
beaten me to it.”</p>
<p>He realized with quick thought that the guard had
been set upon by a number of men who were now at
work on the great strong-box upstairs in the embassy.
They had entered the building in some manner, surprised
the watchman, trussed and bound him and carried
him down into the basement where he would be
safe.</p>
<p>Fay leaned over the guard and hissed into his ear:</p>
<p>“Vas has happened?”</p>
<p>This was as near the language of the Lowland country
as he would ever get.
<!-- 144.png--></p>
<p>“Brumm! Brumm!” choked the guard through
the gag. “Brumm! Brumm! Brumm!”</p>
<p>“All right, old fellow,” said Fay, “if that’s the way
you feel about the matter. I’ll leave you right here
and go on. Cheaters have been cheated before. I’m
going to take a lone hand.”</p>
<p>Fay reached toward his pocket, drew out the American
automatic and pressed the cold muzzle against the
guard’s purpling neck. He backed away, crawled
around the obstruction and started toward the flight
of steps at the front of the basement. He heard a
slight movement above him. Plaster or dust fell to
the floor.</p>
<p>The craftsman took stock of the situation. He now
could see every corner of the room. The yellow light
from the window aided his cell-strengthened eyes.
The five years at Dartmoor had made his sight keen as
a hawk’s.</p>
<p>He touched the first step with his hand, rested his
weight on his palm, and grasping the automatic, started
upward toward the ground floor of the building. He
took his time and worked on the edge of the steps.
Here he knew the least sound would be made by a
prowler. It was a little trick stolen from the old days.</p>
<p>Coming to the next but the last step, he pressed his
body against a side wall, moved back the cocking
mechanism of the automatic and advanced its barrel,
inch by inch.</p>
<p>There were certain sounds in that vast room which
told him that the safe was being ripped apart. Metal
rasped against metal. Rivets were being drawn.
<!-- 145.png-->
Asbestos or plaster of Paris fell to the floor. Also,
there was the squeaky swinging of a great door.</p>
<p>Fay peered around the corner and studied the view
with dry smiling. It was as if someone else was doing
the work cut out for him. Forms moved in the faint
light. Oaths in German rolled from out the vault.
A tool clinked against another.</p>
<p>The light swung and revealed the picture. Fay
studied it keenly. It was framed in the mellow age
of tapestries and portières and heavy draperies.
Portraits of former ambassadors stared from the walls.</p>
<p>The great outer door of the strong-box was open.
The day door hung on one hinge. A candle glowed
within the safe. A man stood on a pile of books. He
was jabbing viciously at the keister door, which had
resisted his stoutest efforts.</p>
<p>Fay realized that this man was Dutch Gus. There was
that in his burly form and thick-lipped oaths to prove
the fact. Two others of the German mob were arranged
about the strong-box. They were gathering
up tools in the belief that their leader would soon succeed
in opening the inner compartment.</p>
<p>The professional smile which changed upon Fay’s
face to supreme disgust would have caused Dutch Gus
considerable concern had he seen it. Fay hated a
bungler worse than a squealer. The wreckage about
the embassy’s strong-box would have disgraced a gang
of blacksmiths. It was the work of tyros at the game.</p>
<p>He waited and watched. The hour was no later
than one. There was ample time to checkmate the
Germans. It was evident that they had made a hasty
<!-- 146.png-->
descent upon the embassy by order of someone high
in authority. The German Government was vastly
interested in getting the key to the cipher. Heaven
and earth would be moved to keep it away from the
English or American agents.</p>
<p>The swaying light of the candle inside the vault went
out with a sudden puff from Dutch Gus’s lungs. A
rattle of gravel sounded on the window panes at the
front of the room. This rattle was repeated. A pane
cracked.</p>
<p>There appeared at the doorway of the strong-box
a face aglow with suspicion. Eyes darted toward the
windows. An oath struck through the room.</p>
<p>Fay raised his automatic and stared forward. He
had sensed with the divination of the professional
what had happened. The skulker in the street was
the lookout for the mob inside the embassy. He had
rounded the square and thrown gravel against the windows
as a prearranged signal of danger.</p>
<p>His voice rose on the outside. It was a tipsy call in
South German:</p>
<p>“<i>Du bist verrücht, mein Kind.</i>”</p>
<p>There was a warning in the simple words. Fay
crouched beside a desk and watched Dutch Gus. The
German bungler was of two minds. He turned toward
his confederates. One of these grasped him by the
arm and pointed toward the door.</p>
<p>“<i>Schnell!</i>” he exclaimed. “<i>Ja, das ist Hugo!</i>”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Fay, tersely. “Yes, the jig is up!”</p>
<p>Dutch Gus snarled as he hurtled toward the desk.
Fay dodged him nimbly and glided to a deeper shadow
<!-- 147.png-->
of the room. More gravel struck the windows. It
was insistent!</p>
<p>The action which followed was blurred. Fay held
his position and watched the three Germans stagger
toward the front door. They dropped tools on the
way. Dutch Gus turned as the knob was turned.
He stared backward like a baffled boar that scented a
trap.</p>
<p>Fay heard shouts outside. There followed a clatter
of heavy heels on the steps leading to the street. A
jimmy came hurtling through the air and dug a hole
in the plaster of the wall. It was Dutch Gus’s parting
shot. His burly form squeezed through the opening
and was gone with a parting snarl which sounded like
“<i>Suchen sie Schutz!</i>”</p>
<p>Acting swiftly now, Fay leaped over the floor of the
room, slammed the front door, bolted and locked it,
then glided toward the shattered outer doors of the
safe.</p>
<p>He had scant time to work in. Already shouts and
calls echoed the streets. Wooden sabots clacked over
the cobbles. A whistle shrilled the night. An alarm
bell started to ring.</p>
<p>“Curse you, you Dutch bungler!” said Fay, springing
to the pile of books and feeling over the plate of the
keister. His rubber-covered fingers found the combination-dial.
This had not been injured. He whirled
it rapidly four times to the right as he thrust his free
hand under his vest and drew forth the stethoscope.</p>
<p>Working with every sense alert, he clapped the
diaphragm of the delicate instrument over the dial’s
<!-- 148.png-->
spindle and thrust the ear-pieces into his ears. He
listened as he spun the dial three times to the left and
then moved it notch by notch.</p>
<p>A click, as faint as a dropping feather, sounded.
He reversed the direction of rotation and listened for
a second click. It came as a rattle outside the door
of the room denoted that guards were attempting to
enter. A stout cry rolled through the embassy.</p>
<p>Fay did not hear this sound. His every effort was
strained on opening the door to the keister where the
cipher-key was located.</p>
<p>He turned the dial to the left and caught the third
click. He needed now but one more to open the
keister.</p>
<p>Slowly his fingers moved, with his brain centered on
catching the faint sound. It seemed a century of
time. He was on the point of giving up and repeating
the entire operation when the last tumbler fell.</p>
<p>Dropping the stethoscope where it dangled from his
ears, he grasped the handle of the door and pulled it
down. It caught and then went into its socket.</p>
<p>Fay opened the door and reached for a match. The
floor shook with the tramp of feet. The air was vibrant
with menace. Fingers seemed to reach for him through
the gloom. Lights flashed beyond the windows.</p>
<p>He scratched the match on the wall of the keister
and shaded it with his palm. Inside was a dusty row
of yellow envelopes, each bound with soiled ribbons.
Above these, on a shelf, stood the many seals of the
embassy. Over these and alone was a packet bound
with string.
<!-- 149.png--></p>
<p>Fay let the match singe his gloves as he eyed this
package. It could be no other than the one left by
the agent who had fled to Holland and there met with
a sudden death.</p>
<p>He reached and brought down this packet, held the
last glow of the match to its top and read the name
scrawled there:</p>
<p>“Otto Mononsonburg.”</p>
<p>He dropped the charred stick and wheeled. Already
the front door of the embassy was giving. The way
seemed blocked. He took his time, however. He
pocketed the stethoscope, crammed the packet into his
left-hand coat’s slit and closed his hand over the butt
of the automatic as he glided out and into the room.</p>
<p>Faces appeared at the windows. They seemed like
pumpkins on racks. The door opened slightly. A
long-barreled rifle was thrust through. Fay stepped
to one side and toward the stairway which led to the
basement.</p>
<p>He paused then and glanced for a last time at the
windows, turned toward the front door, then sauntered
over to the basement steps and went down.</p>
<p>The trussed guard had raised himself to a sitting
position. The bandage was still across his mouth.
Each end of the stick stuck out like a quill. Fay took
care to avoid him, stepped to the window, threw the
catch and lifted the sash. He glanced out.</p>
<p>The garden was deserted. The sounds which came
from the front of the embassy had not yet reached the
side alley. There were any number of these sounds.
They reminded Fay of an aroused bee-hive.
<!-- 150.png--></p>
<p>He passed through the window, pressed down the
sash gently, removed his gloves, and stood erect.
The glueyness of the fog prevented any view of the clock
in the tower of the Hôtel de Ville. It also shrouded
his movements.</p>
<p>He sprang over a garden bed, grasped the coping of
the stone wall and vaulted the obstruction with a half
effort. He landed in a crouching position on the alley
pave.</p>
<p>His hand raised, with the automatic held before him.
He felt his overcoat pocket with his left hand to see
if the package was still there. He rose to an erect
position and started to saunter up the alley and away
from the embassy building.</p>
<p>A shout behind him told that he had been detected.
He turned his head and glanced over his shoulder.
He dropped into a swift run. Two burgers, coming
abreast, were hot on his trail. Their threats in Dutch
echoed and reëchoed. Fay hurried on.</p>
<p>He came to a corner around which he turned. His
eyes swept the street. The way ahead was clear. To
one side, however, and deep within a hallway a form
stood wrapped to the chin in a long coat.</p>
<p>Fay darted by this form with every muscle straining.
He expected a shot or a cry to stop him. He turned
his head as he was half-way down the first block. His
eyes were bright now.</p>
<p>He saw the two burgers puff around the corner.
They were running as one. Their legs were out-thrust
when the muffled figure in the doorway extended a
cane, tripped them up neatly and hurried away.
<!-- 151.png--></p>
<p>Fay chuckled and went on. He was safe! It had
been the reaching arm of Scotland Yard that thrust
out the cane. No one but MacKeenon could have
done that thing half so cleverly.
<!-- 152.png--></p>

<h2 title="X. A Return Stroke" id="chX">
<span style="font-size:1.2em;">CHAPTER X</span><br><span style="font-size:1.1em">A RETURN STROKE</span>
</h2>
<p>Vivid memories remained in Fay’s mind as he reached
the great Hôtel de Ville and turned toward the hostel
where he had left the little silver greyhound.</p>
<p>The key to the dye cipher was safe with him. The
blundering attempts of Dutch Gus and the German
crooks to obtain this key showed that pressure had
been applied from some quarter. The attack upon the
embassy’s safe on the same evening of arrival proved
that the German gang had wind that Scotland Yard
was on the case.</p>
<p>Dutch Gus had failed and the matter was closed,
thought Fay. He felt rather kindly for MacKeenon’s
fortunate trip-up. He glanced over his shoulder as
he passed out of the shadow of the Hôtel de Ville. He
heard, as he walked on tiptoes, the far-off braying of
the police who had most certainly lost his trail.</p>
<p>A bell still tolled within the city. A light showed
here and there. For the most part, however, the way
was through dreaming street and snug-wrapped houses
whose drawn shutters seemed like night-caps.</p>
<p>Fay sniffed the morning fog and found it laden with
promise. It served as a mantle and a cloak. It
would be hours before the Lowland sun broke through
the mist. By then, he figured on being far from the
<!-- 153.png-->
scene of the robbery. There was nothing whatsoever
to be gained by remaining in Holland. He had decided
to deliver the cipher-key to Sir Richard Colstrom
at the house of the Two Lions in West London. At
that same time he would demand a full pardon and the
freedom to live by no man’s leave as long as it was within
the law.</p>
<p>Old scores would be paid. The way was bright.
He searched his mind for any overlooked trifles. There
seemed none. He went on, turned a corner and crossed
a dark street. He knocked boldly upon the stout door
of the hotel.</p>
<p>A second and a third knock brought no answer. A
fourth, however, was followed by footfalls inside and
then the sudden lifting of a sash. Fay stepped back
to the curb-line and glanced upward. The moon-broad
face of the proprietor was beaming down upon
him. A night cap was on his head.</p>
<p>“The doctor!” said Fay with easy assurance.
“Come, let me in!”</p>
<p>Fay heard an exclamation concerning the British
and the hours they kept. The sash went down. The
proprietor appeared at the door with his great keys
jingling like some grotesque St. Nicholas.</p>
<p>“Beastly night,” said Fay, passing him and climbing
the stairs.</p>
<p>He opened his door and stepped into his room. He
found a candle near the wash place where he had
burned Sir Richard’s note. Shading his eyes, he
stooped and glanced beneath the bureau. The thin
cake of soap, wherein he had pressed the silver
<!-- 154.png-->
greyhound, was within the dust. He reached and secured
this with a swift motion. He stood in the center of the
room and turned it in his fingers.</p>
<p>There was much to do and little time to do it in.
The police of the city could not be rated as total fools.
The work at the embassy showed a foreign mind. No
man in Holland was capable of opening an inner
keister without leaving a trace. Fay broke the cake
of soap, took out the insignia and pinned it to his left
lapel. He moved toward the bed. It was his intention
to place the tools he carried in the bag, wait
until the proprietor was slumbering, and then make
his way out into the streets and away from the town.
There were the quays. Ships sailed and steamed for
many ports. Freedom went to the bold!</p>
<p>He had stepped half across the room when a sound
in the hall caused him to poise on his toes with his
hand held rigid before him. He waited with every
sense alert. The sound was repeated. It was the
soft fall of steps. There was also the swish of skirts.
They rustled silkily and out of place in that hotel.</p>
<p>The door opened slightly. Fay cursed himself for
not locking it. Another trifle had come up. He
whipped his hand down to his right coat pocket and
coiled his fingers about the butt of the American automatic
as he lifted its barrel inch by inch.</p>
<p>The door kept opening. It revealed the edge of a
purple hat, a shoulder and then the olive features of
Saidee Isaacs. She stepped in and pressed the door
shut. She turned with her skirts swishing.</p>
<p>“Did you get it?” she asked.
<!-- 155.png--></p>
<p>Fay was mute for once in his life. He figured the
turn of events as he watched her eyes change color
and grow soft. She had hired the auto belonging to
the hotel upon her arrival in Holland. It was natural
that she should stop at the same hotel after her vain
appeal on the quay. Perhaps she had hoped against
hope that he would return to the cipher quest.</p>
<p>“Did you turn the trick, Chester?”</p>
<p>He uncoiled his fingers from the automatic revolver
and laid a finger across his lips. He nodded with a
faint smile as her hand came to him impulsively.</p>
<p>“I got it,” he said. “Dutch Gus was on the steamer
coming in. I couldn’t let him take the safe. As it
was, he came near getting away with it. Sit down,
Saidee, and I’ll tell you what happened.”</p>
<p>He waited as she turned toward the bed and glanced
at it. Her chin swung back and upward. Her eyes
shimmered over with a moist glaze.</p>
<p>“We must leave here, right away,” she said. “If
you got the cipher-key Sir Richard sent you for, my
work and your work is done. We’re fearfully rich
and respected. Why, Chester, the police will bow
every time they see us.”</p>
<p>Fay lowered his voice as he said:</p>
<p>“Not the ones in this town. You’re right—let’s
get out of here. Have you any luggage?”</p>
<p>“Just a small bag.”</p>
<p>“Go back to your room and get it.”</p>
<p>“It’s outside your door. I heard you come in,
and dressed.” She glanced at her reflection in the
mirror over the wash place. She tilted her hat as he
<!-- 156.png-->
crossed the room, removed the tools from his pockets
and breast, opened the little surgical bag and dumped
them inside.</p>
<p>“I’ve got everything,” he said, turning. “We’ll
tiptoe downstairs and make for the Schwartz Canal.
There we can wait till I get a line on the boats.”</p>
<p>“MacKeenon and another are in town. Hadn’t
you better try and connect with them for protection?
It’s wonderful to have the police with you, Chester.”</p>
<p>Fay darted her a sudden look of suspicion. He had
not yet learned to trust the police. They were his
natural enemies. The five years in Dartmoor had not
quenched his old fire. She sensed this as he dropped
his hand to his pocket and turned his face toward the
door.</p>
<p>“They were only helping you,” she said. “Sir
Richard was so interested in the cipher, he thought,
perhaps, you might need assistance. That was all
there—”</p>
<p>“We’ll drop that subject, Saidee. Drop it now.
Sir Richard is like them all—he can’t be trusted.
He told me I could come here alone—scot-free. He’d
get better results if he’d trust a man. We fellows from
the inside are not as black as some people imagine we
are.”</p>
<p>“But this cipher-key is so fearfully important,
Chester. Where have you got it?”</p>
<p>Fay tapped his left overcoat pocket. “Right there!”
he said, glancing from the door to her. “Right where
it stays, too, Saidee, till I see Sir Richard.”</p>
<p>“What is it like?”
<!-- 157.png--></p>
<p>“I didn’t open the package. I’m not going to. Let
Sir Richard do that—after I have a word or two with
him.”</p>
<p>She frowned, with faint lines showing at the corners
of her mouth.</p>
<p>“It might be something we can memorize,” she suggested.</p>
<p>“It’ll keep.”</p>
<p>“But Dutch Gus and all those Germans are after
the clue. Why, Chester, you don’t know how I’ve
worked—in Geneva and Zurich, and in Austria before
it surrendered. Three or four men were killed
over the cipher. You may lose the key. Let me see it.”</p>
<p>He reached upward and buttoned his overcoat by
twisting the buttons with his finger. He lifted the
surgical bag and turned toward the candle.</p>
<p>“When you explain everything,” he said seriously,
“we’ll be pals again. As it is now—you are too close
to Scotland Yard and the hounds to suit me. You
knew when I was coming out of—that place. You
knew I was with Sir Richard in London. You knew
I was bound for Holland. You got here almost as soon
as I did. You left a mighty nice little house in the
West End. Who paid for that house? Who bought
you that motor? You say, ‘Be pals,’ but you are not
the Saidee Isaacs I used to know. Come on! We’re
going out of this trap. The police may hammer on
the street door any minute. Dutch Gus ripped the
big box in the embassy wide open. He made more
‘rumble’ than an old-time German Prince plundering
a French chateau.”
<!-- 158.png--></p>
<p>Fay stooped and pinched the candle’s wick with
his fingers.</p>
<p>He backed across the floor and found that she had
barred the way to the door. He could see her face
from the light that sifted in through the curtain.</p>
<p>“Let’s go,” he said as her breath fanned his cheek.
“Open the door, Saidee.”</p>
<p>“Wait.”</p>
<p>He felt some pity for her at that instant. The lines
about her mouth had softened perceptibly. He had
heard that a man who knows little or nothing about
a woman—idealizes her.</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?” he asked pityingly. “Are you
going to cave in and cry on account of the cipher-key?
I’d give it to you, Saidee, but there is still danger.”</p>
<p>“It isn’t that,” she said as she twisted the knob and
peered out into the hall. “I wanted to see if you were
really in earnest about taking it to Sir Richard. I
don’t want you to take it—anywhere else—Germany,
for instance.”</p>
<p>“Never,” whispered Fay as he seized her arm and
guided her through the hallway.</p>
<p>“Now on tiptoes,” he said as they reached the stairs.
“Hold your bag high and walk on the side of the steps.
That’s right, Saidee. Now back toward a window I
saw. The door is locked toward the street. I heard
him lock it.”</p>
<p>Fay unclasped his fingers from her arm and tried the
window. It led out into the courtyard. He raised
the sash, guided her through the narrow opening, turned
and backed out with both bags. He drew down the
<!-- 159.png-->
sash until the window was closed. Then he stepped
to her side in the gloom.</p>
<p>“This way, pal,” he said with a world of quiet assurance.
“There’s the old auto you hired. And there’s
the way out. I don’t believe we got a rumble. We’re
like two actors beating a board-bill, aren’t we?”</p>
<p>She nodded her head, the plumes of her hat bobbing.
She did not do any of the things which might displease
him. She walked at his side with swift strides.
Her glance was before her without the furtive back-stare
of the amateur. Her voice was natural and pitched
in a low key. They passed a sleepy burger or two.
Once a watchman stepped out and glanced at them.
Fay remembered this and took a side street to throw
the police off his trail.</p>
<p>They reached the first of the taverns and the quays.
Murky, yellow fog wrapped the dykes and lowland.
Spars and masts showed. Funnels and ventilators
were thrust over the roofs of the warehouses. Sails
hung in buntlines and gaskets. Fisher craft loomed
through the mists. The tang of the sea was there in
that inland port.</p>
<p>“Four o’clock,” said Fay, listening to the strokes of
the bell in the Hôtel de Ville. “The police drag-net
will be spread. We’ll go this way, Saidee.”</p>
<p>He grasped her arm and led the way down between
two storehouses whose ends were thrust like fingers
out into the wide pool of the Schwartz Canal. A small
boat with oars was moored to the left-hand pier. Fay
dropped into this, reached and caught the bags as she
tossed them down, then assisted her to a damp seat
<!-- 160.png-->
in the stern of the boat. He cut the painter with his
knife, listened a moment as the boat drifted with the
tide, then he got out the oars and started rowing
toward the opposite bank.</p>
<p>A winding shroud dropped around them. A billowing
mass of wet sea fog rolled over the city and blotted
out the view of the shore and the shipping. There was
no sound save the rattle of the oars in the locks. Fay
bent his back and leaned close to the girl.</p>
<p>“We’re getting on,” he said. “We’ll carry high,
Saidee, and go over the top of this cipher matter.”</p>
<p>She shivered slightly and drew her skirt about her
knees. Her head turned toward the shore they had
quitted. She attempted to pierce the gloom. It was
opalescent and filled with strange lights.</p>
<p>“The police,” said she, “will miss this boat.”</p>
<p>“I’ll kick it out when we land.”</p>
<p>“Holland Yard will coöperate with Scotland Yard.”</p>
<p>“Let them. I’m going to take the cipher-key to
Sir Richard, in person. He had no right sending
MacKeenon on my trail.”</p>
<p>“You still have it, Chester?”</p>
<p>He rested an oar against his knee and drew out the
package. “I’ve still got it,” he said. “Otto Mononsonburg
left it in a safe place—for a German. There
were three doors to take before this package could be
gained.”</p>
<p>He glanced up into her eyes. To him they had
hardened, despite her weariness. There was an eagerness
there he did not like. Calculation had been
foreign to her in the old days.
<!-- 161.png--></p>
<p>Replacing the packet and taking up the oar, he said:</p>
<p>“You’ve changed, Saidee. If I thought you were
going to double-cross me, I’d sink this boat. Your
heart, your mind, your soul is in getting the package.
What does it mean to you?”</p>
<p>She bit her lip and granted him a wan smile. “It
doesn’t mean so much to me, Chester, as it does to
others. You really don’t know what you have done
tonight. You don’t know!”</p>
<p>Fay swung at the oars and tried to sight the shore
of the canal. He sheered the boat and started rowing
vigorously.</p>
<p>Between strokes he said:</p>
<p>“Come out with the truth, Saidee. Remember the
old days. What have you been doing since then?
How did you happen to get mixed up with the Yard?
Don’t you know you can’t trust the police?”</p>
<p>“Your viewpoint will change, Chester.”</p>
<p>“Never!”</p>
<p>“Yes—it will. It will if I ask you to change it.”</p>
<p>He was silent at this. He rowed on until the bow of
the boat struck a sunken pier close to the shore. He
rose, braced his knees against a gunwale and glanced
upward. A rotting quay was close at hand. There
was a ladder coming down from this quay. He reached,
waited, then grasped a rung of the ladder. The boat
steadied as he drew it alongside the pier.</p>
<p>“I’ll go up first,” he said. “You hand me the bags
and then come up. Push the boat away when you
get on the ladder. Push it hard, so it’ll float a long
way before the police find it.”
<!-- 162.png--></p>
<p>He saw her nod her head. He climbed upward,
being careful to avoid the broken rungs of the ladder.
He turned at the top and reached down to her. She
passed up the two bags which he took and laid on
the edge of the pier. Her hand grasped his extended
fingers. She thrust out the boat as she leaped the
gap and trusted herself to him. They stood in the
gloom at the brink of the dark canal.</p>
<p>“All clear,” he said, after listening. “There goes the
boat out toward the sea. We’ll hurry inland and find
a quiet spot. You’re damp. The feathers of your hat
look like Avenue A.”</p>
<p>She drew her jacket about her breast. Her eyes
were bright as she turned and pointed toward the
two bags.</p>
<p>“Carry them,” she said. “Lead and I’ll follow.
It’s almost dawn.”</p>
<p>“We’ll find a dry spot,” said he, lifting the bags and
starting over the quay. “We’ll lay low till noon, then
we’ll figure out the best get-away from Holland. I
think the railroads will be watched.”</p>
<p>“I could carry the package to London without being
suspected.”</p>
<p>He squared his shoulders and walked on. His hands
gripped the bags with white strength. She realized
that she had not gained his confidence in the matter
of the cipher-key. Her feet dragged. She glanced back
now and then.</p>
<p>He came, after taking a long detour, to another
canal which roughly paralleled the one they had
crossed. There was a tiny wooded isle in the center
<!-- 163.png-->
of this canal. A narrow bridge of planks stretched
from the shore to the island.</p>
<p>“A summer place,” he said. “That’ll do, Saidee.”</p>
<p>She held her hand up toward the sky. A mist was
falling. An opal vapor was beyond this mist. The
world seemed wrapped in a great yellow blanket.</p>
<p>“Beastly morning,” he said as he dropped the bags
to his feet. “Suppose they could follow us to here?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I wish the sun would come out.
I’m soaked.”</p>
<p>“Come on,” he said, lifting the bags and starting
over the plank bridge. “We’ll pull one of these up
and then we’ll be safe for a time. Where are we?”</p>
<p>She tiptoed over the bridge and watched him go back
and remove the center plank. This he pulled ashore.
They walked up through dew-laden grass and entered
an open summer-house whose quaint carvings and low
benches, made from natural wood knots, showed the
hand of a Holland builder.</p>
<p>He sat down, drew his coat around his knees and
thrust out his shoes. “I’ll wager, Saidee, we’ve beat
the coppers,” he said, fishing for a cigarette and lighting
it with a sputtering match. “Now you come clean
with what you know and we’ll go back to London
together. I’ll see Sir Richard, get an unconditional
pardon, and we’ll go to the States. The war is nine
months over.”</p>
<p>“But another begins,” she said as she stood before
him. “Don’t you know the most terrible struggles
are the silent ones—the commercial ones that go on
in the dark?”
<!-- 164.png--></p>
<p>“Like the underworld against the police.”</p>
<p>“Please don’t mention the underworld. I’ve been
out of it for five years—so have you. We’ve squared
it. You know my people. I know yours. It’s time
we’re living up to our blue china. Thievery is worse
than cheating at cards. You should use your talents
within the law. Let’s play the game according to the
rules.”</p>
<p>He watched her and puffed at his cigarette. She
walked back and forth over the planks of the summer-house.
The soles of her high-heeled gun-metal shoes
were wet. Her skirt hung dejectedly. The ruching
about her neck had lost its starch. The crowning
touch of the drooping feathers was pathetic.</p>
<p>“I’ve dragged you through hell,” he said, indicating
that she should sit down. “I could make a fire, but
someone might smell it.”</p>
<p>She went to a rail and stared up the canal. A lighter
gray indicated that the sun was breaking through the
clouds to the eastward. The rattle of blocks and the
creak of a sail going up floated down to them. She
turned away and sat down with her hands folded in
her lap. She twisted her finger-rings.</p>
<p>“What happened to you when you joined Scotland
Yard?” he asked point-blankly. “Did they pinch you
for something?”</p>
<p>“No, they did not! They wanted something done
and I was about the only one who could do it. The
war gave me an opportunity to show them what real
good I could do. They paid me for it—paid well.
England never forgets!”
<!-- 165.png--></p>
<p>Fay thought of Dartmoor. “You’re right!” he
exclaimed, tossing the cigarette butt away. “England
never does. So they adopted you and you squared
it and you acted as their agent in Zurich and other
places!”</p>
<p>“Their agents never admit they are their agents.”</p>
<p>“Well put!” said Fay. “I’ve guessed right, though?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And you had something to do with getting that
cipher out of Switzerland?”</p>
<p>“I had a lot to do with getting it to England.”</p>
<p>“And when you got it to Sir Richard—the key was
missing?”</p>
<p>She laid her hand over his left overcoat pocket.
“You’ve finished what I couldn’t,” she said.</p>
<p>Fay leaned back. He listened, then drew out his
cigarette-case and selected a cigarette. She watched
him intently.</p>
<p>“It’s after six o’clock,” he said as he struck a match.
“See, it’s cracking dawn everywhere. The fog will go
and leave us sitting in the open. Suppose we plant
the bags, walk ashore, and try the north bank of the
Schwartz Canal for a ship out of Holland. We don’t
care where it goes, if it gets us to England.”</p>
<p>“It would be better for me to look for MacKeenon
and give him the package. He will give us a receipt
which you can show to Sir Richard. That receipt
will free you from the five years hanging over your
head, Chester.”</p>
<p>“I don’t play the game that way!” he said, rising
and staring down at her. “I’ll be my own messenger.
<!-- 166.png-->
I was sent after a thing, and I got it. That hound,
MacKeenon, might claim the credit. He might say
I fell down on the job. He’s looking for a reputation.”</p>
<p>She realized that he was not to be moved from his
purpose. Her eyes blazed defiance as she sprang up.</p>
<p>“Have it your own way!” she said. “But, Chester,
you’re foolish! Don’t you know that Germany would
give a million pounds out of the Spandau Tower—to
keep England and the States from solving the cipher?
It means Germany’s financial ruin in the dye industries.
The world learned how to make potash,
during the war—it hasn’t learned how to make good
dyes cheaply. The whole thing is in that cipher.”</p>
<p>“I saw it, Saidee. There were hundreds and hundreds
of sheets of paper with letters on them. The letters
seemed to be grouped—three to a group.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I worked on it. We all worked on it! I even
got little Danny Nugent from Soho to try his hand.
Remember Danny? He used to stay awake nights
working out ciphers so the police couldn’t read them.
He says the dye cipher is impossible—that it follows
no known rule.”</p>
<p>“Sir Richard told me that,” said Fay. “Well, we
got the answer,” he added, glancing keenly around.
“We got it, Saidee, and we’re going to deliver it in
person. We—”</p>
<p>She clutched his arm at that moment.</p>
<p>“What is that moving up the canal?” she asked
tensely. “See it, Chester! Is it a boat, close to the
bank?”</p>
<p>He drew her down and stared through the latticed
<!-- 167.png-->
bars of the summer-house. A shadow moved within
the bank’s shadow. A ripple showed like the gleam
of a silver wing. Sounds of oars in locks floated to
them. Then, and suddenly, all was still. A murky
billow rolled over the lowland and blotted out the canal
from view.</p>
<p>He reached and drew the bags to him. He thrust
his fingers within a crack and lifted a sodden plank.
Leaves and moss were beneath the flooring. A toad
hopped away.</p>
<p>“There’s room here,” he said, pressing down the
two bags. “We’ll come back for them when we find
a ship.”</p>
<p>Replacing the plank, he rose and stared toward where
he had seen the shadow. The fog had thickened. He
could see nothing save the dark surface of the canal.</p>
<p>They crossed to the shore, after he had closed the
little bridge with the board. They glanced back, then
hurried on toward the Schwartz Canal. The pathway
they took was winding and long.</p>
<p>It was a mile below where they had first crossed
the Canal in a boat, before he stopped and pointed
ahead.</p>
<p>“A ship,” he said. “See the masts?”</p>
<p>They went on through the lowland path and came
to a bridge. The draw was closed. Burgers and lorries
passed from bank to bank. The smell of fish and clams
was in the air. The fog had not yet cleared from the
surfaces. Above the fog, windmills and spires showed
in spectral outlines.</p>
<p>Fay led the way to the gangplank of the ship. He
<!-- 168.png-->
paused there and studied its outlines. It was a rusty
tramp, engaged in the North Sea trade. Its one funnel
bore the Blue-D mark of the Holland line. A row of
white doors on the boat deck indicated that passengers
were carried.</p>
<p>He told Saidee Isaacs to wait as he turned and
climbed up the plank. A sovereign pressed into the
hand of a Dutch steward, who stood at the head of
the plank, gained an instant ear. Fay took two staterooms
on the starboard side after ascertaining that
the ship would steam within an hour, and that her
destination would be Stavanger, with Lemvig, in Denmark,
as a port of call.</p>
<p>“You go aboard and wait,” he said as he descended
the plank and moved to her side. “I’ll get the bags
and be right back. The ship sails in an hour for Stavanger.
From there we can double to Scotland by the
Aberdeen Line. From Aberdeen we can catch the
Royal Scotch Mail for London.”</p>
<p>“Be careful,” was all she said as she started up the
plank.</p>
<p>He hurried back to the bridge, crowded between
two burgers who were carrying nets, and gained the
opposite bank of the canal. He took the path with
his head held high, his arms down at his sides. The
fog was thick. There were sounds ahead, of creaking
windmills and of lowland cattle.</p>
<p>He went on, picking the dry places between the
puddles. He came to a marsh with white stones in a
row, across it. The fog hung heavily. The way
ahead was through a clinging veil.
<!-- 169.png--></p>
<p>Suddenly a whistle shrilled the damp air. A blare
sounded behind him. Fay leaped to the bank of the
marsh and started running down the narrow path
which would take him to the plank bridge and the
little summer-house where the bags were.</p>
<p>He struck, with sudden force, a taut wire which was
stretched across the trail. He went forward and down
upon his knees. His hands were deep in mire. He
tried to raise himself, and twisted sideways. His feet
were snared.</p>
<p>Out of the fog, on either side of him, there burst
two muffled figures. Each had an arm over his face.
Both clutched revolvers. One was Dutch Gus!</p>
<p>A blow from a stone thrown by a third enemy
drove the cracksman’s head down into the swamp.
He attempted to reach his right hand back for his
automatic. He felt his senses go, after a whirling
struggle to retain consciousness. A second stone
spattered mud at his side. A voice cautioned
moderation.</p>
<p>Hands crept over his overcoat and then under his
vest. The stethoscope and the surgical tools were
drawn out. The packet in his pocket decided the
searchers. Dutch Gus had found what he was after.
He rose and called the name.</p>
<p>“Otto Mononsonburg! Here it is, boys!”</p>
<p>A second whistle shrilled within the fog. Fay lay
still as the patter of feet sounded and then died to
echoes. He drew up his arm and passed it over his
head. Blood was on his fingers. He lifted himself
slowly on his right elbow. He stared about and then
<!-- 170.png-->
staggered to his feet. He went through his pockets.
Everything had been taken. His hand lifted to the
lapel of his coat. The greyhound was still there.</p>
<p>“They left that,” he said slowly. “They left that.
Which way did they go?”</p>
<p>He gathered himself together with a final effort.
Hot blood surged to his cheeks. He found his cap
and pulled it on. He searched the pathway in the
direction of the summer-house. The footprints pointed
the other way. He retraced his steps and reached the
edge of the marsh.</p>
<p>A Bank of England note lay between two stones.
It had been dropped by Dutch Gus. Fay picked it
up, folded it, and went on toward the Schwartz Canal
like an Apache after scalps.</p>
<p>He reached the bridge and stepped into the stream
of burgers. He saw them eyeing him. The reason lay
in his blood-stained face and muddy overcoat. He
crossed to the south bank and turned toward the
ship.</p>
<p>Grimly determined to have the thing out, he decided
to tell Saidee Isaacs what had happened, and then
take up the search for Dutch Gus and the cipher-key.
He passed the first of the shore lines. A seaman in a
torn blouse was standing by these. A voice was bulling
from the ridiculously high bridge of the freighter. The
screw churned.</p>
<p>Fay shouted and leaped for the gangplank. He
climbed upward and reached the deck. There was
still time to get Saidee Isaacs ashore. He would need
her now.
<!-- 171.png--></p>
<p>A face that was stamped with unforgettable memory
stared out from a cabin. A door closed with a slam.
Fay backed against the rail of the ship and passed his
hand over his forehead.</p>
<p>Dutch Gus had fled to the same ship! They would
make the passage to Stavanger together.
<!-- 172.png--></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 title="XI. Checkmated" id="chXI">
<span style="font-size:1.2em;">CHAPTER XI</span><br><span style="font-size:1.1em">CHECKMATED</span>
</h2>
<p>Fay’s first movement was a start of surprise. He
gripped the rail and waited as the dingy Dutch ship
backed, starboarded, then started to turn in the
confined waters of the canal.</p>
<p>Over him surged a rage which mounted in hot waves
of blood to his temples. He stood before the door,
behind which crouched the man who had set the trap
in the Holland marsh, and who held the cipher-key.</p>
<p>He felt caution vanish in one desire. He bunched
his muscles and hurtled toward the door. He struck
it with staggering force. A crash resounded above the
sounds of shore-leaving. Seamen hurried in his direction.
Seeing red, and grimly determined to smash
through to Dutch Gus, he glided back against the rail,
then lunged forward—this time with double force.</p>
<p>The stout door was immovable. One panel gave,
however. Through this opening an arm was thrust.
A funnel of crimson fire stabbed the night. A bullet
clipped a piece from the rail. A roar sounded as a
second shot was fired from an American revolver.</p>
<p>Fay staggered to one side of the door and wiped his
face. He had not been struck. The blood that showed
was from the old stone bruise. A sailor clutched his
arm. He swiftly turned.
<!-- 173.png--></p>
<p>“There’s a crazy man in that cabin,” he explained.
“Open it up so I can see what is the matter with him.”</p>
<p>“I dank you better look out,” said the seaman.
“I dank I better see der capitan. Ya, dat fellow is
crazy!”</p>
<p>Dutch Gus thrust out the automatic revolver. A
Holland mate appeared and swung down from the
boat deck. He stared at Fay and then at the smashed
panel.</p>
<p>The cracksman pointed toward the door.</p>
<p>“You’ve got a mad passenger. He almost killed me.
You should put him in irons,” he declared firmly.</p>
<p>The mate glanced at Fay. He turned and advanced
toward the cabin door. The automatic was jerked
inside. A table or shelf was held over the opening.
The crook was taking no chances. He had barricaded
himself inside the cabin! A mattress and a blanket
were stuffed in the opening.</p>
<p>Fay saw the uselessness of arguing the matter. A
bo’swain and two seamen conferred with the mate. A
purser came up. Fay grasped his arm and asked:</p>
<p>“Where is the lady I was with? What is the number
of her cabin?”</p>
<p>The purser jerked his head toward the stern of the
boat. Fay followed him through the gloom. The
ship was gliding by the shores of the canal. The fog
was heavy—impenetrable. The siren aft the funnel
blared a long-drawn warning. Bridges were swung to
let the ship pass. Fisher boats were drawn out of the
way.</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs stood at the rail in the stern of the
<!-- 174.png-->
freighter. Boxes, bales and crates formed a barricade
between her and the cabins. She had not noticed the
commotion in the forward part of the ship. Fay dismissed
the purser and glided to her side.</p>
<p>“Come to your cabin!” he exclaimed bitterly.
“Dutch Gus has stolen the cipher-key! He’s aboard.
But I’ll get it from him!—I’m in this thing, now—all
the way!”</p>
<p>“Where—when?” she questioned eagerly. “Checkmated?”</p>
<p>Fay stared at the sea over the stern of the ship.
His face grew gloomy with thought. It came to him
with the force of a blow that he had been careless in
the matter—so careless that it would be very hard
to explain to Sir Richard.</p>
<p>“Yes, he beat me to it,” he said, lowering his voice
and backing against the rail. “He’s got the package
that contains the key in his cabin.”</p>
<p>“You dropped it—lost it?”</p>
<p>Fay pressed his hand over his forehead. A stain
of blood was on his fingers as he drew them away.</p>
<p>“It was when I went back for the bags—the thing
happened, Saidee. I’m not over it yet. I got what
I deserve for being so careless.”</p>
<p>The cracksman paused and stared into her crimsoning
face. The olive beauty was gone. In its place had
crept a saffron hue which seemed to center in her
eyes. She stamped her foot on the deck.</p>
<p>“Come on,” he said wearily. “Let’s go to your
cabin. Climb over these bales. Look out for that
tackle. Now through these crates.”
<!-- 175.png--></p>
<p>He seized her arm and guided her through the last
of the deck stores. They mounted a short ladder and
hurried forward. The two cabins assigned to them
by the purser were upon the opposite side of the ship
from the one occupied by Dutch Gus.</p>
<p>She hastily got out a key, twisted it in her trembling
fingers and opened her door. She entered and switched
on the light. He followed her after a glance up the
deck. He drew her door closed.</p>
<p>“Now, explain everything,” she whispered as she
leaned forward and studied his blood-stained face.
“Just how did you come to lose it?”</p>
<p>Fay drew off his cap and tossed it to the bunk. She
helped him with his overcoat. She stood near the
door as he rolled up his sleeves, glanced swiftly at the
blood stains, then started pouring water from a
racked-pitcher.</p>
<p>“Wait till I clean up,” he replied, lathing his hands.
“Dutch Gus took everything. They knocked me out
and went through my pockets. The package—my
money—the revolver—everything is gone. It reminded
me of Chicago—only worse!”</p>
<p>She caught the laugh in his voice. It reassured her.
He was far from being beaten.</p>
<p>“Have you any money?” he asked, turning his hands
toward the light and staring at them.</p>
<p>“Yes! Plenty! Thank goodness, mine wasn’t in my
bag. But almost everything else was!”</p>
<p>“You don’t happen to have a gun?” He dipped his
face into fresh water, mopped his hair, then reached
for a towel.
<!-- 176.png--></p>
<p>“I’ve a little one. It’s loaded.”</p>
<p>“Better give it to me. I’m going to get Dutch Gus
before this ship reaches land. He can’t get away with
what he has done. Part of his gang is aboard. I don’t
care. He’s lived entirely too long, for the good of the
world, Saidee.”</p>
<p>She caught the new, determined note in his voice.
It steadied her. She stooped, turned up the bottom
of her skirt and drew out from a secret pocket a tiny
silver-plated revolver of superior make.</p>
<p>Glancing at it, she dropped her skirt and thrust it
into his reaching hand.</p>
<p>He twirled the barrel, pocketed the revolver and put
on his coat, overcoat and cap.</p>
<p>“I was pretty rough,” he said apologetically.
“You’ll have to forgive that part. I’m going after
Dutch Gus, Saidee.”</p>
<p>“Be careful. Can’t you wait till the ship lands?”</p>
<p>“No! It’ll put into Denmark. Germany has agents
there who will come aboard and take Dutch Gus with
them. It’s now or never.”</p>
<p>Fay stepped to the door and moved it partly open.
He stared out. Turning his head, he said:</p>
<p>“The fog is lifting—I see dykes and the open sea.
I’ll go around on the other side and wait by his door.
I won’t let him out. You try this side and see if you
can find any of his pals. There were two or three of
them. Perhaps they didn’t all come aboard.”</p>
<p>“Is there any way we could wireless MacKeenon?”</p>
<p>“Too late for that. The ship will put into Denmark
early in the afternoon.”
<!-- 177.png--></p>
<p>She watched him disappear through the door and
glide toward the stern. Arranging her hat in the
mirror and frowning at her disheveled appearance, she
hurried to the deck and started forward.</p>
<p>Two skulkers by an outswung life-boat turned their
faces away and pretended to watch the shore. She
saw that they were Germans and that their shoes were
caked with marsh-mud. She turned at the pilot-house
and glanced back. They were eyeing her sharply.</p>
<p>Fay stood by the rail directly in front of Dutch
Gus’s cabin. He raised his cap as she hurried in his
direction. A steward and a deck hand had nailed a
barricade before the shattered door. No sound came
from inside the cabin.</p>
<p>“All right,” said Fay, without moving his lips. “He
is trapped. They think he’s crazy. He can’t get out,
but we can’t get in. The captain says he’ll call the
port officers when we reach Denmark.”</p>
<p>“And some of them will be German agents.”</p>
<p>Fay admitted this by a slow nod. He backed against
the rail, hooked his heel into a netting and eyed the
door for all the world like a man who was there to
stay.</p>
<p>She realized what was passing in his mind. The
time was slipping by. Already the open water had
been reached. The ship would soon be in the North sea.
A slight rocking foretold the seas to come.</p>
<p>Glancing toward the bow, she puckered her brow.
Her thoughts were on the cipher-key. It was in the
hands of Dutch Gus. He well knew its value. He
had followed her from Holland to London and from
<!-- 178.png-->
London back to Holland in the quest. There seemed
no way to get him out of the cabin before the ship
put into port.</p>
<p>Fay dropped his heel to the deck. They were out
of ear-shot of the steward and the deck-hand who were
standing guard over the remarkable passenger.</p>
<p>“I’ve a plan,” she said with the brevity of a man.</p>
<p>“What—is it?”</p>
<p>“Set the ship on fire and get him when he comes
out.”</p>
<p>Fay glanced at her in admiration. “Good!” he
said. “Good idea, but—”</p>
<p>“But what?”</p>
<p>He turned and studied the sea. A fog draped the
lowlands. Beyond, rocks and hills rose. A ridge
followed the coast line. The wind was from the north
and west. Sailing craft dotted the ocean.</p>
<p>“If we burn this boat,” he said to her. “If we do—and
I can do it—we might burn him with the
cipher-key. He couldn’t get out of the cabin soon
enough. This ship’s loaded with inflammable crates.”</p>
<p>“But we must do something.”</p>
<p>He lifted his chin and stared at the funnel and the
pilot-house. He turned and counted the small-boats.
His eyes darted swiftly over the superstructure.
They fastened finally upon a companion with a handrail.
It led downward to the engine-room. A grimy
Dutch coal-passer was leaning over the rail, smoking
a pipe. His shirt was open to the waist. His belt was
a black-tarred rope’s end.</p>
<p>“I’ve got it!” said Fay, suddenly. “See where that
<!-- 179.png-->
hatch leads? Look, Saidee! It leads to the stoke-hold
and the engine-room.”</p>
<p>“To the bottom of the ship?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>“I’m going around the deck and count the boats.
I don’t think there are but four. There’s not more
than six or seven passengers. The crew can’t number
over fifteen—counting the engineers and the stokers.
Twenty or twenty-two souls—all told. We’ll get
Dutch Gus out into the open where we can handle
him. Come on!”</p>
<p>“Are you going to leave him alone?”</p>
<p>“Yes! He won’t trust that cipher-key to anybody.
It’s sealed. He won’t open it. He’s certainly got it
with him. It’ll be with him when the crash happens.
Go to your cabin. I want you to stay there till I
come for you.”</p>
<p>She followed him around the stern. He opened her
cabin door, after a shrewd glance at the two Germans
by the life-boat, and went in.</p>
<p>“Stay here,” he said. “We’re sure to be watched,
together. I’ll be back in ten minutes. I’m going below,
and if this ship is what I think it is—we’ll get
the cipher-key. You look out every minute and watch
the Germans. Follow them if they go to Dutch Gus’s
cabin.”</p>
<p>He darted away from the girl and around the stern
of the ship. Already a heavy swell was lifting the bow.
There was a promise of more seas to come. The fog
had lightened in patches. Vistas showed, framed by
<!-- 180.png-->
dragging vapor like the ropes of huge Zeppelins. A
glint of sun slanted over the coast of Holland. The
ship was skirting the coast line. It was in danger of
floating mines which had broken loose before peace
had been declared.</p>
<p>He paused in his steps, after descending the ladder
and advancing part of the distance to the engine-room
companion. The Dutch stoker, with his pipe, was still
taking the air.</p>
<p>“Can I go down?” Fay asked as he pointed toward
the deck. “I’d like to see the engines.”</p>
<p>“Engines, <i>Ja</i>!” said the stoker, removing his pipe and
pressing the bowl with a broad thumb. “<i>Ja! Ja!</i>”</p>
<p>“Thanks,” said Fay, grasping the curved hand-rail
and turning in his descent. He glanced at the waves
apprehensively.</p>
<p>He reached the grating and stood in the gloom between
a rusty bulkhead and a triple-expansion engine.
He saw, high over his head, a row of open port-holes.
He had marked these from the deck. They had given
him the plan to save the cipher-key.</p>
<p>An oil-incrusted engineer passed without noticing
him. Fay started aft. There was a maze of injector-pumps,
bilge-pumps, condenser-pipes and steam leaders
on the starboard side of the engine. He saw the
hand wheels of the sea-cocks. These were well down
on their threads in a closed position. He glanced at
the open hatch.</p>
<p>His chance came as the same surly engineer shouted
an order and vanished through the bulkhead-door
which led to the stoke-hold. It was a free and easy
<!-- 181.png-->
ship such as is found in the coast service of Holland
and the North Countries. He worked swiftly as he
opened three of the sea-cocks. He paused on the
ladder which led to the engine-room companion.
Running water sounded within the space between the
double skin of the ship. Bilge muck seeped along the
gratings. An oily patch glistened and reflected the
light from a yellow lantern.</p>
<p>Fay descended the ladder and waited at the foot.
He was not sure that he had done everything necessary
to sink the ship. There might be an automatic
stop on the sea-valves. An indicator bell was liable
to ring. He leaned and listened. Sounds came to him
of shovels scraping over the iron plates in the stoke-hold.
There was a smell of hot oil about the engine
room. The clanking of the engines seemed slowed for
some reason.</p>
<p>Gripping the palms of his hands with his fingernails,
he waited for someone to come aft and report
the water. It would be easy then to explain that he
had come down the ladder to investigate the matter.</p>
<p>An oath in Dutch sounded from the stoke-hold. A
coal-passer threw down a shovel. There was an argument
between the engineer who had gone forward
and the stoker. Hot words rolled through the bulkhead
door. This would serve to gain time. Fay suddenly
glanced at the deck. It was almost a foot deep
with brine.</p>
<p>He turned and climbed the ladder swiftly. He passed
the Dutchman at the engine-room companion, who was
still smoking his pipe. The mild eyes of the man
<!-- 182.png-->
made no sign. A heavy veil of fog and mist rolled
over the ship’s bow and wrapped the standing
rigging.</p>
<p>Fay stared about the deck. A bo’swain stood in
the chains on the starboard side. He swung a lead
line but did not let it go. The skipper leaned out of
the side door of the pilot-house. His eyes were on
the fog.</p>
<p>A sudden sickening lunge of the bow showed that
the ship had taken aboard much water. This action
escaped the seamen. They stood at their position—unaware
that the deck had lowered toward the surface
of the water.</p>
<p>Fay thrust his hands into his overcoat pockets and
climbed to the boat-deck. He felt the cool surge of
victory. A few minutes more and there would be no
saving power to keep the vessel from a watery grave.
Already it was water-logged and sluggish.</p>
<p>He turned and saw Saidee Isaacs standing in the
doorway of her cabin. She was watching the two
Germans who were sheltered by the long-boat. Fay
moved along the canted deck and grasped her arm.</p>
<p>“Get ready for trouble,” he whispered buoyantly.
“Have you anything in the cabin you want? You
won’t have a chance to get it later.”</p>
<p>“What have you done?”</p>
<p>He loosened his grip and smiled at the thought of
the open sea-cocks. “I’ve done enough,” he said.
“I didn’t think it could be done. This is a sleepy
ship.”</p>
<p>“Have you set fire to it?”
<!-- 183.png--></p>
<p>Fay leaned against the cabin sheathing and marked
the nearness of the sea.</p>
<p>“Not quite as bad as that,” he said, pressing his hand
against the sheathing. “I’ve scuttled her, though, or
think I have. I opened almost everything with a
wheel on it, below. As soon as the alarm is given,
I want you to hurry to the after boat and pull the
plug. One boat ought to be enough for the crew and
passengers. There will be a sort of a panic. They’ll
all get away, though, except the man we want. He’s
nailed tight in his cabin.”</p>
<p>Fay stepped to the rail and leaned over. The reaching
waves which curled to the scupper holes seemed
like white fangs. The alarm had not yet been given!</p>
<p>“Tell me what you have done,” she asked again.</p>
<p>“Opened the sea-cocks, Saidee.”</p>
<p>“But—I don’t understand.”</p>
<p>“You will! This won’t be the first ship that has
been sunk in the same manner. I don’t think there is
any way to save her. See, she’s listing to starboard.
Hear the crew?”</p>
<p>They stepped to the cabin door. The Germans by
the life-boat had vanished. A running of footsteps
sounded overhead. The hoarse voice of the captain
blared through the fog. An oiler burst through the
engine-room companion and staggered forward.</p>
<p>“She’s sinking!” he shouted in English. “Der
ship is sinking!”</p>
<p>“I hope it is,” said Fay. “The fools haven’t sense
enough to shut off the sea-cocks and start the bilge
pumps. A little black water in an engine room is very
<!-- 184.png-->
disconcerting. Come, Saidee,” he added. “Dutch
Gus will be driven from his cabin like a rat from a
hole.”</p>
<p>She walked past him. He saw her climb to the
after boat and jerk at the lanyard of the wooden
plug. The cord broke. He passed around the pilot-house,
grasped a hand-rail and lowered himself to the
starboard side as the ship lurched and her bow went
under a northern wave.</p>
<p>Pandemonium seized the decks. The crew and the
engine-room force lost their heads. Their one thought
was to outboard the life-boats and get away. Burly
forms loomed through the fog. Knives slashed at the
boats’ lashings. Fay heard a cry from aft. A boat
had already been lowered. He glided along the canted
deck and saw that the door to Dutch Gus’s cabin was
still barred. The German crook had been deserted
by his companions. The planks, nailed in place by
the purser and the deck hand, were stout ones.</p>
<p>Fay waited until Saidee Isaacs came through the
fog and the sea-spray. She was water-soaked and
frightened. She had seen the crew deserting the
ship.</p>
<p>“Get by that forward boat!” he ordered. “I’ll be
there in a minute. The ship will float a little longer.
Stand by, Saidee, and wait for me!”</p>
<p>He grasped the rail and edged toward Dutch Gus’s
door. Stout blows indicated that the crook was
trying to pound his way out. The panels had been
shattered. The way was barred by the planks which
were nailed to the sills.
<!-- 185.png--></p>
<p>The cracksman grasped the end of one of these,
braced his feet against the cabin-sheathing, and
jerked the plank from its nail hold. He dropped his
hand swiftly to his side pocket and drew out the tiny
revolver. Poising it, he waited grimly.</p>
<p>First the shock-head and then the evil, heavy-browed
eyes of the crook appeared. These were followed by
his shoulders.</p>
<p>“Get back!” snapped Fay, thrusting forward his
revolver. “Get back—you—Get back!”</p>
<p>Fay moved toward Saidee Isaacs. She was standing
helplessly by the boat’s falls.</p>
<p>“Cast these off,” he said, bending and untwisting
the ropes from the cleats. “That’s right, help! Now
get into the boat. I’ll lower it. See, it goes out and
down. The water isn’t far.”</p>
<p>A reaching comber lapped over the bow of the
doomed freighter and curled along the upper decks.
Fay braced himself against this flood. He saw the
boat lift and then drop into a trough of the waves. It
crashed against the ship’s plates. Saidee Isaacs was
thrown against a gunwale. She raised to her knees and
glanced helplessly up at him.</p>
<p>He turned and darted a swift survey of the canted
deck. Dutch Gus was crawling through the opening
between the planks. The stern of the ship was a swelter
of foam and curling eddies. A small-boat, crowded
with Dutch seamen, tossed like an egg-shell upon the
crest of a wave. It disappeared in the hollow between
two great seas.</p>
<p>Fay climbed over the rail, waited, then leaped the
<!-- 186.png-->
distance for the small-boat. He landed in the stern
and fell sideways. He rose and grasped the gunwales;
Saidee Isaacs’s face was not more than a foot from
his. Her dark eyes had opened to their widest proportions.
Her hat and waist were sodden with brine.</p>
<p>He smiled reassuringly. “Buck up, Saidee!” he
said. “Think of poor Dutch Gus. Watch, when
he jumps.”</p>
<p>Wonder broke through the beauty of her eyes. She
turned and stood erect. The dingy freighter was on
the verge of its last plunge. The starboard rails were
under the sea. A single figure climbed for the highest
places. It appeared on the top of the pilot-house.
Fog wrapped the standing rigging. Wind and mist
blotted out the view.</p>
<p>The view returned. The figure was now close by the
funnel. Hands were raised impotently toward the
heavens. The German in Dutch Gus had caved. He
cried, and the sea mocked him.</p>
<p>Fay loosened a pair of oars, sat down, and swung
the bow of the small boat toward the ship. He sensed
his position and bent his back. The ship went down in
a geyser of white foam. The upper deck-cabins and
ventilators were sheered from their holding-bolts. The
sea churned with white wreckage.</p>
<p>Out of this wreckage there appeared a bobbing
head. Fay swung the boat and rowed in the direction
of this head. He waited, inboarded his oars and rose
with the tiny revolver clutched tightly in his hand.
Saidee Isaacs leaned over the bow. She pointed toward
Dutch Gus.
<!-- 187.png--></p>
<p>The German crook was going down for the second
time when Fay leaped forward and reached out his
right hand.</p>
<p>He caught a firm grip upon the swimmer’s neckband.
He jerked backward and lifted Dutch Gus out
of the sucking sea. The girl stumbled to the stern of
the boat as the bow went under and water cascaded
over the seats. She stood erect and watched Fay.</p>
<p>Taking no chances, he laid the form over a gunwale
and searched the pockets. He found a pasty mass
of Bank of England notes and some gold. A knife,
cartridges, papers and a notebook followed.</p>
<p>He deposited these on a seat and rose. He glanced
over the sea. There was no sign of the other boats
of the ship. Wreckage and floating crates lifted and
fell with the waves. Fog swirled and wreathed about
the spot where the freighter had gone down.</p>
<p>Stooping swiftly, Fay unbuttoned the German’s
clothes and removed a money-belt. There was a bulge
near the buckle of this. The buckle was hard to open.
Fay turned, steadied himself, and snatched up the
knife. He opened a blade with his strong teeth. He
slit the chamois of the belt and drew out the cipher-key.
It was sealed. It had not been tampered with.
The paper with which it was bound was wet.</p>
<p>“We win!” he exclaimed as he turned toward the
girl in the stern of the boat. “He’s checkmated!”</p>
<p>Her eyes flashed. She clutched the tossing gunwale
with her fingers. She poised as he held up the package.</p>
<p>“Give it to me, Chester,” she said. “I’ll take care
of it.”
<!-- 188.png--></p>
<p>He extended his arm and passed the package to her.
“It may be worth the price,” he said. “Guard it
carefully.”</p>
<p>He wheeled and stepped toward Dutch Gus. The
German lay half in and half out of the water. His
legs dragged through the waves. Fay rolled back the
eye-lids and studied the pupils. He felt the pulse.</p>
<p>Turning then and searching the bottom of the boat,
he saw a dry place where he could lay him. He lifted
the body and staggered aft with it. He dropped it
between the center and the stern-seat.</p>
<p>“Come forward,” he said to the girl. “He isn’t
armed! We’ll wait till he recovers his senses and then
we’ll make him row us ashore. It can’t be more than
six or seven miles.”</p>
<p>Dutch Gus stirred at this statement. He threw up
an arm and rolled over on his face. His hand crept
toward his waist with sly, creeping jerks.</p>
<p>Fay smiled as the girl came to his side and sat
down on the forward seat. “Watch,” he whispered.
“He’s shamming! Watch, when he misses the
package.”</p>
<p>A savage roar greeted the discovery of the loss.
Dutch Gus doubled, turned, and lifted himself by
grasping the starboard gunwale of the boat. He glared
forward. His eyes were blood-shot and baleful. He
saw the tiny revolver come up inch by inch until its
muzzle pointed straight for his forehead.</p>
<p>“Row!” said Fay. “Take up those oars and go to
work. I plucked you clean! You lost the gun you stole
from me when the ship sunk. This one is a six-gun
<!-- 189.png-->
with steel bullets and smokeless-powder. It’s little,
but it’ll do the work!”</p>
<p>The crook’s eyes wavered. They searched the tossing
sea, which was fog-shrouded. They returned to the
sight of the little gun held so steadily. They dropped
to the oars.</p>
<p>“That’s right,” said Fay. “Sit backwards and fall
to. It’s only seven miles, Dutch. Why did you pick
such an awful coast?”</p>
<p>The German had no answer for this question. He
staggered to his feet and stared about with savage
eyes. Each time he turned toward the stern of the
boat, he saw the little silver-plated revolver.</p>
<p>“Sit down!” said Fay. “Take up those oars! I’ll
give you ’till I count three. One!”</p>
<p>Dutch Gus dropped to the seat and picked up an
oar. He outboarded this, then reached for the other.
His broad back and sodden clothes blotted out the
view astern. He swung his body and cursed as the
oars missed the water. He dug the blades too deeply.
He made poor progress.</p>
<p>Fay reached and pressed the cold muzzle of the
gun against the German’s purple neck where it showed
above the collar.</p>
<p>“A little faster,” said the cracksman. “Try it
again. It’s only six or seven miles.”</p>
<p>The girl glanced now and then over her shoulder.
The fog along the coast was heavier than any veil.
Beneath this fog the sea lifted and dropped with a
long-drawn moan.</p>
<p>An hour passed with the boat making slight
<!-- 190.png-->
headway. Fay shifted the revolver to his left hand. They
were caught in a current which was bearing them
toward the coast faster than the German could ever
row. An island showed through the fog. A ship blared
a signal.</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs rose, stood on the seat, balanced herself
against Fay’s shoulder, and called. She repeated
the call. It was unanswered. An echo mocked them
as a faint cry was thrown backward.</p>
<p>“Sit down!” commanded Fay. “It isn’t far, now.
See? That’s land! That isn’t fog. Over there!”</p>
<p>He pointed the gun toward where a murky mass of
vapor was backed by a deeper shadow.</p>
<p>She glanced over the boat’s side. The water was
yellow—from mud.</p>
<p>“We’re nearing shore,” she said.</p>
<p>He stared at her. They both were buoyant with the
thought of the cipher-key. It drove away sleep and
weariness. Now and then she touched the hiding
place and smiled at him.</p>
<p>Dutch Gus rested on his oars and breathed heavily.
Fay clicked the cocking mechanism of the little revolver.
The German did not turn. He bent forward
swiftly and dragged backward. He repeated the
motion. The fear of death had crept through his
brain.</p>
<p>An island, mud-shored and barren, lifted out of the
sea. It was no larger than the deck of a ship. Rocks
showed where the high-tide had washed. There was
a white line on these rocks.</p>
<p>“Starboard, a little,” said Fay. “No, the other
<!-- 191.png-->
oar!” he snapped. “That’s right. Make for the
island. I’m going to maroon you there.”</p>
<p>The German rose as the boat grounded. He turned
and stared downward at the menace of the revolver.
It was compelling. The steady finger through the
trigger-guard, the eye that flashed over the sights,
meant death, and quickly.</p>
<p>“Get over the bow and wade!”</p>
<p>Fay said no more. He crouched by lifting himself
partly from the seat. He watched Dutch Gus leap
from the boat and sink to his waist in mud and water.
He turned the gun and handed it to Saidee Isaacs.</p>
<p>Taking the oars, he drove the light craft far off the
shore and in the direction of the mainland. Each time
he feathered the blades he saw the lone figure standing
by the rocks. A clenched fist was raised to the overhanging
pall of fog and sea vapor. A horrible curse
rolled over the waters.</p>
<p>Fay turned away and glanced into Saidee Isaacs’
olive face. She smiled with her eyes. She pointed over
the bow. He nodded and bent his back. The boat
reached an inlet between two high promontories. He
guided it ashore and inboarded the oars with a jerk
of his wrists.</p>
<p>She stepped out and seized the painter. Fay sprang
over the seats and assisted her. They stood on a shelving
beach which bore the marks of fisher-boats’ keels.</p>
<p>“We’ll go up there,” he said, pointing to a path
which wound around the sea end of the northern
promontory.</p>
<p>She followed him. He turned now and then and
<!-- 192.png-->
assisted her to climb the rougher spots. They came
to a shelf which was directly over the sea. They stood
and gazed out toward the island whereon Dutch Gus
was marooned. It was hidden by the sea mist.</p>
<p>“Let me see the package,” he said, fastening his
glance upon her. “Let’s open it and find out what it
is. Then, if it is ever lost we’ll know how to solve the
riddle of the dye-cipher. I’d rather have it in my head
than where it can be stolen.”</p>
<p>“Do you think we should open it?” she asked, thrusting
her hand in her waist at the breast. “Don’t you
think we can wait?”</p>
<p>“No! We might get stopped yet, Saidee. We don’t
know where we are. This may be Denmark. The
coast guards may search us.”</p>
<p>She handed him the package. He glanced at the
strings and the seals. They had been untouched. He
studied the name blotted by the sea water into a running
smear.</p>
<p>“It’s all right,” said he with satisfaction. “Dutch
Gus never opened it—but I’m going to. You’re my
witness, Saidee. Here goes.”</p>
<p>He drew the German’s knife from his pocket and
cut the strings. He ran the thin point of the blade
under the seals. There were five of them joining the
paper. He unwrapped the covering and held out an
oblong box which was stamped with a small, “Made
in Germany” mark.</p>
<p>Lifting the lid, he peered inside!</p>
<p>Her warm breath struck his cheek. Her gasp of
surprise was followed by a disappointed cry. Her
<!-- 193.png-->
hands raised and clutched the soiled ruching at her
throat. She stamped her foot.</p>
<p>Inside the box was a pair of smoked-glasses!</p>
<p>Fay lifted his white, drawn face and glared toward
the sea. He swayed as he drew the box with its contents
back and over his right shoulder. He flushed
suddenly with the memory of the trip he had taken.
Rage crimsoned his features.</p>
<p>“Sent me!” he exclaimed huskily. “They sent me
through hell to get this trifle. You, Richard, and you,
Keenon—are mad!”</p>
<p>The box and the glasses described a flashing arc
through the air. They struck the sullen waves below
the shelf of dark rock. They sank in many fathoms
of brine. A winding shroud of opal vapor swirled and
enclosed them in its clammy folds. It was like a pall
to all his hopes!

</h2>
<p>Saidee Isaacs was the first to recover her voice
and reason. She seized Fay’s left arm and drew him
away from the edge of the cliff. She feared that he
might cast himself into the sea.</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t have thrown them away,” she said
quickly. “Chester—you should have looked them
over carefully. Perhaps—”</p>
<p>“I’m done! To think what a fool I’ve been. We’ve
both been gulled. It is the end of a wild-goose chase—if
ever there was one!”</p>
<p>She let go of his arm. Her face lifted to his. She
saw his eyes flash out and over the sea. A bitter light
was in their depths. Defiance flamed there. He
squared his shoulders and dropped his hands to his
sides.</p>
<p>“Come on!” he said. “Let’s go inland and find
out where we are. We can get a railroad train or
something for the north. The country is full of refugees
and broken soldiers. No one will notice us. We can
go to Stavanger and then to the States.”</p>
<p>She furrowed her brows and blocked his way by
thrusting her body before him.</p>
<p>“We mustn’t leave here yet!” she declared positively.
<!-- 195.png-->
“You’ve done something you shouldn’t have done.
Suppose the key was written on the wrapping paper
of that package. Suppose the smoked-glasses were
hollow—or something like that. We wouldn’t expect
the key to be right out in plain view. I wonder
if there is any way to get them back?”</p>
<p>“Get them back? No! I never want to see them!
I’m done—I say! They were ordinary glasses like
beggars or blind men buy for a shilling. There was
nothing on the wrapper or the box. The whole thing
was a hoax—or an accident.”</p>
<p>“Do you think that the embassy would put such a
thing in the inner box of their strongest safe?”</p>
<p>“They didn’t know what was in the package.”</p>
<p>“But, Chester, they refused to give it up—either
to Germany or to England. They knew it was important.
They knew that the commercial war was on.
The signing of peace had nothing to do with the dye
secrets. They belong to the man who is strong enough
and clever enough to get them. You got the key to
the whole thing—then threw it away.”</p>
<p>Fay stared back over the pathway. He hesitated,
then turned toward the girl. Her eyes were dark and
smoldering. She was very sure of herself. The fire
within her had reddened her olive cheeks. Her lips
had hardened.</p>
<p>“I despise you!” she said. “You’re so thoughtless!
You overlook the trifles of life. What are we going to
say to Sir Richard?”</p>
<p>“Sir Richard will never find me. You can go back!
I’m going to the States. I’m done, I tell you!”
<!-- 196.png--></p>
<p>She realized that he was not to be moved from his
declaration.</p>
<p>“How deep is the water where you threw the glasses?”
she asked as he did not move from his position.</p>
<p>“Fifty or sixty feet, Saidee. There’s an undertow
and tides and waves. It’s no use! Let’s forget the
smoked-glasses and go to Stavanger. We’ve got a
right to live in this world. Has the Yard any strings
on you?”</p>
<p>She did not answer him. Instead, she stepped to
the edge of the cliff and glanced downward. She
swayed, braced her foot and stood there in an attitude
of thought. Finally she turned and came back to him.</p>
<p>Her hand clutched his left arm as she drew him
toward the side rocks and a shelter from the wind.
She spread her damp skirt and sat down upon a driftwood
plank which someone had carried up from the
sea. She dropped her face in her hands. He watched
her.</p>
<p>“Quit that!” he said with feeling. “What are you
doing—crying?”</p>
<p>She glanced up swiftly. Her eyes were bright and
free from tears. “I’m thinking, Chester,” she said,
“of a number of things. I’m not like other women—or
girls. I can hate and I can despise. I almost hate
you, now. Your friends are Sir Richard and MacKeenon.
They helped me get you out of Dartmoor.
You say they did it for a purpose. Granting that
does not change matters. The purpose is a high one.
You responded at first. You took their parole and went
to Holland. Now, when you may have held the key
<!-- 197.png-->
to the dye cipher in your hand, you threw it away.
You talk of going to Stavanger and to the States.
Don’t you realize the obligation you owe to me?”</p>
<p>Fay shook his head with emphasis. “I realize that
the whole thing is up,” he said feelingly. “I hate
Scotland Yard, now! They sent me on a venture
filled with dangers for me, and none for them. They
took a chance that the package in the embassy’s safe
was the cipher-key. They didn’t know any more about
it than I did. It’s proved! Do you think a clever
German chemist would have a key hidden in a pair of
smoked-glasses? He left them with the embassy for
a gull. The true key, if there was one, died with
him.”</p>
<p>“Then Dutch Gus and the others were wrong?”</p>
<p>Fay raised his brows. “I hadn’t thought of that,”
he said slowly. “It does look queer. But a pair of
smoked-glasses don’t answer the riddle.”</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t have thrown them into the sea.”</p>
<p>“You don’t think I was going to take anything like
that back to Sir Richard, do you?”</p>
<p>She rose and stood before him. Her hands were
straight down at her sides. Her upturned face was
heated and burning. She flashed an inner signal which
he did not understand.</p>
<p>“I despise you now,” she said slowly. “You’re
clever and you’re keen-brained and you’re cool-headed,
but you overlook the trifles. You have failed a dozen
times on account of trifles. You can’t see that little
things have vast importance, sometimes. The smoked-glasses
were a trifle. You threw them away before I
<!-- 198.png-->
knew what you were doing. Suppose they turn out
to be the cipher-key.”</p>
<p>Fay drew away from her a step. “Suppose they do,”
he said. “We can’t ever get them back. Why not
quit arguing in a circle and come down to facts? I
want you to go to Stavanger with me. I need a pal,
who is a sticker. We’ll forget England and what
happened there. I’ll never say I was at Dartmoor.
I can change my name and live the thing down. I
want to get away from the memory of that cell and
those guards and the sneaking servants of the law.
I want the open places where I can see the stars.”</p>
<p>She softened her glance perceptibly. He swept her
slender form. Her skirt, her shoes, her waist and
feather-dragging hat, were all sea-soaked and mist-flattened.
Her eyes and the jewels on her fingers alone
spoke the Saidee Isaacs of other days.</p>
<p>“Come on,” he said, snatching up her hand.
“There’s a trail inland and a wide world to walk in.
Let’s find a hay-mow or barn and go to sleep. We’ll
feel better when we wake up. I’m sorry about the
glasses, but I hated the thing from the beginning and
now I know I was right.”</p>
<p>She feared to temporize with him. He had one
virtue which outweighed his faults. She knew in his
heart there was loyalty. He had never been known
to turn on a friend.</p>
<p>“I still hate you,” she said. “I’ll always hate you
for what you did with the glasses. Perhaps we can
get them. I want to remember this place.”</p>
<p>Turning, she stared out over the shelf of rock and
<!-- 199.png-->
widened her eyes for landmarks. There was an island
which loomed through the mist. There was an opposite
point of dark crags. The inlet at her left hand
would be marked on a good chart of that coast.</p>
<p>He went on up the pathway and waited for her. His
coat was drawn over his body. His cap was pulled
far down upon his head. He twisted a button with
long white fingers which were slightly stained with
oakum. It was the brand of Dartmoor.</p>
<p>“We’ll go,” he said as she stepped to his side, “over
the ridge and down into the lowland. I’m dead for
sleep. We better avoid the main roads until I get
my senses. Dutch Gus or some of the others of his
gang may have landed. They’ll notify the Germans.
Come on, Saidee, buck up, and don’t look so doleful!”</p>
<p>She flushed and followed him. He helped her now
and then over the rough places. They came to a cleft
in the rock. Through this opening a vista was to be
had of a sloping highland which disappeared within
the gray mists which rose from a long, straight canal.</p>
<p>Fay pointed toward a windmill whose arms were still.
A huge barn and hay-rick showed at the junction of
two fences. Cattle grazed on the damp grass.</p>
<p>“We’ll make that,” he said, pointing toward the
hay-mow. “I must have sleep—I’m hardly myself.”</p>
<p>An Airedale, with an erect tail and a burr-clustered
hide, came running up to them as they reached the
fence. He sniffed at Fay’s coat, then stared at the
girl with a wise cant to his head.</p>
<p>“He’ll stand watch,” said the cracksman. “I’ll bet
he thinks we’re refugees from Germany.”
<!-- 200.png--></p>
<p>She twisted her rings and glanced over the farm.
There was nobody in sight. A pale feather of smoke
rose from a chimney. Pans and churns stood outside
the kitchen of a stone house. It was a picture of
Holland comfort set in a winding mist.</p>
<p>Fay reached the hay-mow and pointed toward an
opening. “Crawl in there,” he said. “I’ll find another
suite. Wake me when you wake. I must have
sleep.”</p>
<p>She laughed almost hysterically. “With these
rings?” she asked turning toward the farm-house.
“Are we safe?”</p>
<p>“In Holland, yes,” yawned Fay, covering his mouth
with his right hand. “They don’t lock the doors in
this country—an old crook told me who ought to
know. Good-night, Saidee!”</p>
<p>He stooped, patted the dog, then rounded the hay-mow.
There was a second opening which had evidently
been made by cattle feeding. There were
marks of hoofs about it. Fay crawled within the hay,
rolled over, covered his face with his arm and started
reviewing the events of the day. He dozed with half-thoughts
trooping through his brain. He woke, hours
later, turned on his side, listened, then backed out
from his cramped position. The mist had cleared.
The stars were out. A light shone in the farm-house
window. The dog was still on guard.</p>
<p>Fay rubbed his eyes and rounded the hay-mow.</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs’s shoes were all he saw at first. He
seized a foot and shook it gently. She squirmed out
to him, sat erect, then glanced back toward the opening.
<!-- 201.png--></p>
<p>“Get my hat,” she said. “I hope you’re satisfied,”
she added hotly. “I didn’t sleep a wink. I waited
for you all afternoon.”</p>
<p>“Like a good pal,” he smiled.</p>
<p>“No—like a fool!”</p>
<p>He shrugged his shoulders. “Politics and crime,”
he said, “make strange companions. I’m feeling fit,
now, and you’re ready to fight. Let’s go on to the
nearest town, get some coffee and whatever else they
have, then take the trail to Stavanger.”</p>
<p>“You can go to Stavanger! I’m going to London—first
train! I’ve a house there—a motor—and self-respect.
If I follow you, I’ll find myself in the—in
another hay-mow.”</p>
<p>He watched her attempts to pin her hat on her head.
She jabbed the only remaining hat-pin through the
crown at least a score of times. She tightened her lips
as she stared at him.</p>
<p>“What are you laughing at?” she asked suddenly.
“It isn’t a bit funny. I’m supposed to have some self-respect.
I think I’ve lost it all.”</p>
<p>Fay crammed his hands deep within his pockets and
bent his knees. He shook his head slightly. There
was the thin ghost of a smile on his face.</p>
<p>“Oh, say now!” he said. “It’s better to wake
up in a pile of hay than in a stony cell. I thought I
was back in Dartmoor till I smelled the clover.”</p>
<p>She lowered her hands from her hat and stared at
her rings. Her fingers strayed over her skirt and
finished by a swift brush at the hem. She straightened
and tried to return his smile.
<!-- 202.png--></p>
<p>“I’m hungry!” she said savagely. “I’m hungry
and I don’t care who knows it. Let’s go to that farm-house
and knock. I’ll kill you for this!”</p>
<p>Fay burst into an uproar of mirth. “Lady Isaacs,
and look at you!” he retorted. “Suppose Sir Richard
should see you now!”</p>
<p>She glanced at her shoes ruefully. She stamped one
foot, then stared at the dog. Her eyes swung upward
toward Fay’s lips.</p>
<p>“I insist,” she said, “that we go to that house and
get something to eat. I must wash my hands and
brush myself off.”</p>
<p>“I’ll go, Saidee. You stay right here. It wouldn’t
do for both of us to be seen at this time of night. I’ll
say I was wrecked on the coast. Then we can go on
into some town.”</p>
<p>Fay swung and started off toward the light in the
farm-house. He was preceded by the Airedale, who
barked once, leaped up the steps and scratched on the
kitchen-door.</p>
<p>A broad-faced Hollander of the better sort peered
out. To him, Fay offered two shillings for sandwiches.
The man was joined by a woman who understood some
English. She pressed back the shillings, took command,
beckoned Fay inside the neatest kitchen he
had ever seen, and there bustled about until a package
of food was wrapped up and handed to him.</p>
<p>“Thanks,” he said, thrusting it under his coat. “I’m
a thousand times obliged. Now can you tell me the
way to the railroad? The <i>chemin de fer</i>?”</p>
<p>“<i>Der Bahnhof?</i>” asked the burger in German.
<!-- 203.png--></p>
<p>“Yes,” said Fay. “By all means, yes!”</p>
<p>The man went to the door, and pointed toward a
road which crossed the canal at a sharp angle. His
finger steadied in an easterly direction. He glanced
at Fay.</p>
<p>“I understand,” said the cracksman, shifting the
bundle of sandwiches under his arm. “That way?
I’m much obliged! Thanks, good <i>frau</i>,” he added
gallantly. “I guess there’s queer people knock on
Holland doors these days—but none queerer than
myself. Good-by!”</p>
<p>Fay hurried through the gloom. He turned once
and saw the couple, who seemed to be childless, standing
in the oval light of the open door. At their feet
sat the dog, his intelligent head held sideways.</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs was waiting behind the hay-mow.
To her, Fay handed the package of sandwiches.</p>
<p>“I know the way to the railroad station,” he said.
“We’ll eat as we walk. We can get something to drink
in the canal or a brook. It’s pot luck, Saidee, till we
reach civilization.”</p>
<p>They crossed the canal by a narrow bridge and
descended to the eastern bank. A white road showed
which struck inland through the mist. Barns and
windmills loomed over the top of well-kept hedges.
A wagon passed which was drawn by oxen. The
sleepy driver turned and watched the unusual vision
that had attracted him.</p>
<p>Suddenly Fay stopped and stared at the girl. A
light shone ahead. A whistle had sounded. A roar
was in the air of a train streaking through the night.
<!-- 204.png--></p>
<p>“I think we can get a train north from there,” Fay
said, pointing toward the light. “We’ll go to Delfzijl,
at the mouth of the Ems, and from there we’ll get a
boat to Stavanger or some port in Norway.”</p>
<p>She glanced back, then turned toward him.</p>
<p>“I’ll get a train south,” she said. “There is no use
arguing. My mind is set!”</p>
<p>Fay smiled and hooked his right arm within the
cove of her own. “You’re coming with me, Saidee,”
he commanded. “You’re coming for a good reason,
too. That sleep did me a world of good. You were
right about those glasses. I shouldn’t have thrown
them into the sea. There’s something in them—after
all.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I mean that a woman’s intuition was better than
a man’s judgment. I thought they were a trifle.
Perhaps they were—but there’s a big doubt.”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk in riddles. What have you discovered?”</p>
<p>He stared about the road and then pointed toward
the light.</p>
<p>“We’ll move fast,” he said. “We must go to
Stavanger and find if Ace-in-the-hole Harry—his
right name is Harry Raymond—is there, or if he has
taken a boat for the States.”</p>
<p>She stared at him as if he had gone insane.</p>
<p>“I never heard of such a man or such a name. The
idea of going to Stavanger to see an individual called
<i>that</i>! Why, Chester!”</p>
<p>“That’s right,” he said, “jump at conclusions.
Now you’re wrong and I was wrong. Ace-in-the-hole
<!-- 205.png-->
Harry is the king of the deep-sea Greeks. He knows
more about card manipulation than any man living.
He is working the boats and the pigeons and the new
flock of commercial travelers who have gold. He can
rob a man at poker or at fan-tan. He can deal seconds
or hold out three aces. I saw him in the smoking-room
of the <i>Flushing</i>, coming over to Holland. From
there he was going to Stavanger. I heard him say
so.”</p>
<p>“Do you think I would associate with him?”</p>
<p>“Yes—when I tell you he wore smoked-glasses exactly
like the pair I threw away!”</p>
<p>She flushed and held herself back. She broke away
from him and flashed an arch glance of query.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?” she asked. “What have his
glasses got to do with the cipher-key?”</p>
<p>“That, I don’t know. All I do know is, there’s
something rotten in Holland or Denmark when a man
can do what he did with those glasses on. He knew
every card. He trimmed a gull without half trying.
There’s a connection between the smoked-glasses and
the cipher. I’m sure of that now. Will you go with
me to Stavanger and help look up Harry Raymond?
We can get in a game with him and try to find out how
he does it. He’s clever enough to think of most everything.”</p>
<p>“You should have mentioned that before,” she said,
grasping his arm. “It is a clue, Chester. I’ll go to
Stavanger.”</p>
<p>The road led through a patch of marshy ground,
over a stile, across a rising lea-land, and then upon
<!-- 206.png-->
a railroad embankment which stretched north and
south as straight as a ruler.</p>
<p>Fay studied the rails, then led the way toward the
switch-points and an empty goods train which had
been shunted from the main line. The tarpaulins
of this train were dripping with moisture. The train
crew had gone up the metals to the low, stone-built
station. A green light gleamed from a signal-arm.</p>
<p>“Looks like a way station in Kansas,” said Fay as
he helped the girl climb to a high platform. “We
ought to see a tin-star marshal standing round chewing
on a straw.”</p>
<p>A sleepy-eyed operator was in the office. He raised
the tiny frosted window as Fay knocked with his
knuckles on the glass. Two of a train crew stirred
from the benches in the waiting-room. They sat erect
and stared across the gloom.</p>
<p>“I want to go to Delfzijl,” said Fay to the operator
and clerk. “I think you pronounce it that way,” he
added keenly. “This lady and I must go!”</p>
<p>A guard lumbered across the room and spoke rapidly
in Dutch to the operator. He turned to Fay.</p>
<p>“You’ll get a train in one hour,” he said in fair
English. “The matter will be a simple one, sir. How
came you in this part of Holland?”</p>
<p>“I might ask you the same question,” said Fay good-naturedly.
“You have the first American voice I’ve
heard in some time.”</p>
<p>“American, no! Alberta, yes,” grinned the goods-train
guard. “I spent three years in the Canadian
wheat countries.”
<!-- 207.png--></p>
<p>Fay booked passage by passing through the tiny
window enough British gold to take an entire first-class
compartment. He went outside and pulled a
low truck within the shelter of the platform. He
waited until Saidee Isaacs had seated herself. Then
he said:</p>
<p>“The game starts, Saidee! I hope we’re on the
right scent. I wonder what peculiar property is in
the smoked-glasses Harry Raymond wears? They
certainly help him win—at cards.”</p>
<p>“A double glass or something hidden in the lenses,”
she suggested.</p>
<p>“Something hidden, yes!” said Fay. “Something
hidden—go and find it,” he quoted thoughtfully.</p>
<p>The goods-train crew, who were evidently awaiting
the coming of the north-bound train, stirred finally.
They came out yawning, glanced at the two wanderers
on the truck, then crossed the tracks in the direction
of their train which was headed by a squat, open-cab
locomotive.</p>
<p>A cone of white fire burst through the fog. A rumble
and a whistle echoed over the moorlands. The train
came to a grinding pause as Fay grasped Saidee Isaacs
by the arm and ran down the station platform in the
direction of the single first-class carriage.</p>
<p>They stood on the running-board as the train started.</p>
<p>Fay jerked a door open and helped the girl inside.
She sank back on shiny leather cushions and breathed
a long sigh of relief. She was glancing at herself in a
mirror when the guard came along for the tickets.
Fay asked him concerning the boat which met the
<!-- 208.png-->
train. It would be there, the guard explained with
many gestures, but its first port of call was Christiansand
instead of Stavanger.</p>
<p>Fay nodded his head. The guard closed the door.
The trip, with Saidee Isaacs huddled into one corner
of the compartment, her eyes closed and her hat down
over her face, was made without accident. Now and
then Fay peered out at the landscape. It was mostly
lowland and dykes and the ever-prevailing windmills
which seemed so characteristic of Holland.</p>
<p>Delfzijl was reached just before dawn, and this
allowed ample time to connect with the boat. Fay
purchased clean linen and gloves for the girl and himself.
They went up the gangplank of the <i>Romsdal</i>—a
North Sea and Skagerrack boat with impossible
cuisine and soiled cabins.</p>
<p>Hurtled northward, the passage took all the day
and the better portion of the following night. The few
passengers were totally uninteresting. Fay spoke to
all of them. He had difficulty in making himself
understood. One, only, a commercial traveler out of
England, named Fairhold, showed interest in the
cracksman’s questions.</p>
<p>He boxed the events since the signing of peace like
a mariner going over the compass points. He showed
the trend of affairs commercial. He dwelt, in his
heavy, drawling voice, on traffic and trafficking—on
the silent embargo against all things German—on the
bitter needs of the North Countries in cotton and rubber
and wool.</p>
<p>Fay led to the dye question and received a blank
<!-- 209.png-->
stare. The man, who proved to be from Nottingham,
did not handle print-goods or calicos or hosiery. Not
handling them, he knew nothing about them. He
explained confidentially that he was interested solely
in brass hair-pins and wire-goods. Fay saw no reason
at all for keeping this a deep secret.</p>
<p>“That hair-pin drummer,” he told Saidee Isaacs as
he knocked on the door of her cabin and was admitted,
“says there’s a train to Stavanger which goes at daylight.
He also declares that the big boats leave Arendal for
the States. What shall we do? Perhaps we’ll find
Harry Raymond at Arendal instead of Stavanger.”</p>
<p>“Can we try both?” she asked.</p>
<p>“I think so. We’ll go to the nearest big port—Arendal.
If he isn’t there, we’ll cross Norway during
the day and try Stavanger. He had a cockney stall
with him. I’d know either man in a million. Harry
has a drawl like a music-hall performer. He’s an
American crook who apes the English. They always
overdo it.”</p>
<p>She showed him her hat after smiling faintly. The
plumes had dried and were presentable. Her ruching
was pressed and turned. Her shoes had been touched
up with the corner of a towel and some polish supplied
by the deck-steward.</p>
<p>He studied her hair—blue-black, coiled from right
to left—before she placed her hat on her head. Her
lashes matched her hair to the fraction-shade. Her
olive eyes held the faint suggestion of the Oriental—particularly
in their inscrutable droop.</p>
<p>“You look splendid!” he declared with admiration.
<!-- 210.png-->
“I’m glad you changed your mind about coming north.
I think—candidly, we’re going to find out something
from Harry Raymond. He won’t talk to me—or tell
me anything—but he don’t know you. You have a
clever way that’ll get through his guard. Perhaps
he’ll play Banker and Broker with you. It’s an easy
game to trim a gull with.”</p>
<p>“Gull?” Her brows raised to polite arches of inquiry
at the argot.</p>
<p>“I mean pigeon,” he said, hardly making matters
better. “He’ll play you for one, if you act right and
don’t overact.”</p>
<p>“You seem confident that we’ll run across him.”</p>
<p>“He only works the big ports and the fast boats.
He’s sure to be in Arendal or Stavanger. Or else he’s
on the ocean.”</p>
<p>She rose from the bunk and switched out her light.
“Let’s go on deck,” she said, pressing open the door and
glancing out. “There’s the coast of Norway, over there—so
the steward says. We’ll soon be in port.”</p>
<p>Fay leaned over the rail and studied the dark shadow
toward which the ship was plunging. He wondered
what fortune lay in the path he had chosen.</p>
<p>Events moved swiftly enough after the ship docked.
Fay called a carriage and was driven rapidly to the
railroad station, where he learned that a train would
leave within ten minutes for Arendal.</p>
<p>Daylight, which came early, was breaking as the
tiny locomotive puffed into the great Skagerrack Port
where boats could be taken for a score of points—including
the States.
<!-- 211.png--></p>
<p>One huge ship was in sight. Its long row of deck
lights had not been extinguished. Lighters were alongside
loading coal and a general cargo. A few all-night
passengers were standing near the taffrail.</p>
<p>“She leaves at sun-down,” the station-master told
Fay after he had inquired. “You can book passage
on Nordland Street.”</p>
<p>Fay turned toward the girl. “We’ll ride around,”
he said, “and look over the hotel registers. I’d know
our friend Harry’s writing if I ever saw it. There’ll be
a Count or a Duke or an M.P. or a mere Lord in front
of it. He never played a small game.”</p>
<p>Their search, carried well into the afternoon, was
almost without result. One clerk recalled seeing such
a couple as Fay described—a tall Englishman with
a monocle or smoked-glasses, and a cockney who wore
as many buttons as a coster-monger.</p>
<p>The direction which they had taken from the hotel
might have been to the railroad station or to the docks.
Fay wasted time searching for a definite clue. It was
only when the hoarse blare of the great siren on the
ship announced its immediate departure that he acted
on the last chance.</p>
<p>He grasped the girl’s arm and hurried her to the
booking-office of the steamship line where a surly clerk
had refused to show him the passenger list of the
<i>Drammen</i>—the one ship in port.</p>
<p>“Two tickets to Stavanger,” he said. “I understand
the <i>Drammen</i> puts in there.” He turned his
lapel and showed the silver greyhound.</p>
<p>The clerk tossed out two first-class tickets, then
<!-- 212.png-->
opened the safe for change of the Bank of England
note Fay had pressed forward.</p>
<p>Ten minutes later they were being rowed out to the
<i>Drammen</i>. The landing-stage was being drawn up as
the boat rounded a towering stern and swung alongside
the rusty plates. The stage dropped with a splash.
Fay tossed the boatman some silver coins and assisted
the girl up the steep climb. He passed through the
rail and found a cabin-steward.</p>
<p>“Stavanger!” he said commandingly. “Two first-class
cabins for that port. I don’t know whether the
booking-clerk gave me good cabins—but I want them!”</p>
<p>The girl followed the steward as the stage came up
and the screw thrashed astern. Fay glided forward
and glanced into the smoking-room. No one was
there. There was no sign of Harry Raymond or his
companion on the decks. He searched them all.</p>
<p>It was at the captain’s table, during the dinner hour,
that there appeared two figures which once seen could
never be forgotten. Fay had taken the precaution to
interpose a Norwegian traveler between himself and
Saidee Isaacs.</p>
<p>He coughed and attracted her attention. She
lifted a glass of water from the rack and glanced coolly
over its edge. She, too, studied the two men who had
taken designated seats at the purser’s table.</p>
<p>Harry Raymond was resplendent in a Bond Street
creation of shepherd plaid and a fancy vest. An insignia
dangled from a ribbon across his waist. His
eyes were hidden behind a great pair of smoked-glasses.
His voice drawled across the dining saloon like a prime
<!-- 213.png-->
minister’s or a cabinet member’s. His companion
was the horsey-looking cockney who had aided in
trimming the Yorkshire squire on the <i>Flushing</i>.</p>
<p>Fay did not glance in their direction during the meal.
He rose before Saidee Isaacs had finished eating. He
passed to the deck and leaned over the rail at the after
end of the boat-deck. Below him was the square
block of a hatch crowned with a fan-shaped derrick-mast.
Over this mast loomed the jack-staff with the
Norwegian Merchant Flag flying.</p>
<p>Astern glowed the phosphor of a restless sea divided
by the white wake of the ship. The dark coast of
Norway showed like a cloud bank on the starboard
beam. Fay turned and stared at this highland. Hours
passed with him in the same position. Passengers
strolled upon the deck. The stewards appeared with
steamer chairs and heavy wraps. The twin funnels of
the boat flared from the inner fires. The single screw
jiggled and thrashed. The stars came out and torched
the overhead velvet.</p>
<p>Suddenly quick footsteps glided to his side. Saidee
Isaacs turned and glanced forward as she laid a hand
on his wrist. She closed her fingers and clutched with
hot strength.</p>
<p>“It’s all right,” she whispered without turning her
head. “I flirted with him and found out any number
of things. He and his companion are going to New
York. This ship reaches Stravanger at sun-up. He’s
still wearing the smoked-glasses, Chester.”</p>
<p>“How about a card game?”</p>
<p>“All fixed, Chester. He’ll start one in a few minutes.
<!-- 214.png-->
He’s invited me to join him at Bridge. My partner
will be a stupid Russian with plenty of money. He’s
the one who sat next to the captain.”</p>
<p>“Where do you play?”</p>
<p>“In the Ladies’ Saloon. There’s a port-hole just
over where I’ll insist that Harry Raymond sits. He’s
supposed to be the Right Honorable Frederick Lonsdale—this
passage.”</p>
<p>“I’ll be at that port-hole,” replied Fay.

<h2 title="XIII. The Long Arm" id="chXIII">
<span style="font-size:1.2em;">CHAPTER XIII</span><br><span style="font-size:1.1em">THE LONG ARM</span>
</h2>
<p>Saidee Isaacs lifted her hand from Fay’s arm,
swung with the movement of the ship, then hurried
forward toward the direction of the Ladies’ Saloon
where the game of Bridge was scheduled.</p>
<p>Fay watched her vanish in the glow of the deck-lights.
He saw a door open and then close. A shaft of mellow
fire struck out onto the rail and the crisscrossed waves.
It vanished. The long deck was deserted.</p>
<p>The cracksman crammed his hands into the side
pockets of his overcoat, fished out a cigarette and lighted
it by the quick scratch of a match on his heel. His
eyes were useless over the period of a minute. Gradually
sight and clear vision came to him. He removed
the cigarette and stared at its glowing end. He
pasted it to his lower lip and started around to the port
side of the ship.</p>
<p>Passengers were seated there to the number of a
score or more. They were crouched in sheltered chairs
or between the ventilators and the outswung boats.
A regulation was still in effect regarding these. German
mines, so profusely distributed during the period
of the war, might be encountered at any moment.
Many ships had been lost in the same waters.</p>
<p>Fay reached midship and the shelter of a ladder
<!-- 216.png-->
which led upward to the hurricane deck. He drew
out his watch, held it sideways toward a luminous
port-hole and stared at the dial. Saidee Isaacs had
ample time to arrange the setting for the bridge game.
It should be well in progress.</p>
<p>He moved slowly forward as if seeking shelter. He
reached the first of the port-holes which marked the
Ladies’ Saloon. These were partly curtained with
many-colored silks.</p>
<p>Glancing inside, Fay saw a group of passengers about
an upright piano. A singer stood at one end of the
piano. She held a sheet of music in her hand. Beyond
her, and close up to the sheathing of the cabin,
an alcove showed within which sat Saidee Isaacs, a
stout Russian, the cockney stall and Harry Raymond,
whose back was turned from Fay’s view.</p>
<p>Fay glided to the nearest port-hole, leaned back,
surveyed the deck, then tossed his cigarette away and
gradually thrust his head toward the round disc of the
port-glass.</p>
<p>The view inside held all the charm of eavesdropping.
The warm colors of the Saloon, the tinkling notes of
the piano, the woman’s rather faded voice—that
echoed within the surge and hiss of the sea—wove a
spell.</p>
<p>Fay narrowed his eyes and studied the cards which
were held in the sharper’s hand. He glanced at the
table and the exposed dummy. He mentally caught the
fortunes of the game by the expression of rage on the
face of the Russian and the soft, slow smile of Saidee
Isaacs.
<!-- 217.png--></p>
<p>The points were shilling ones and the stakes rather
high. Harry Raymond had evidently doubled the
shilling point on every occasion. He played into his
partner’s hand, took the lead and finished the round
by collecting twelve out of thirteen tricks.</p>
<p>The Russian, who had dealt and lost, stared at the
sharper with a savage bristling of his beard. Saidee
glanced up and into Fay’s eyes where they were glued
to the glass of the port-hole. She made no sign save
to rub her brow thoughtfully. Fay studied the
sharper’s back and the great bows of the glasses he
wore. There was no chance to peer through the lenses.</p>
<p>The game went on with Harry Raymond and his
partner winning as if the backs of the cards were open
books to them.</p>
<p>Fay, himself, wondered at this exhibition of uncanny
skill. He furrowed his brows and drew his head away
from the port-hole. He went over all the things he
had ever heard concerning card-manipulation. A
vision came to him of a table at “Jimmy’s,” in London,
and a conversation between two deep-sea card players.
They had told of dealing seconds, and holding out, and
even of buying up the entire stock of cards on a ship
and supplying a purser with marked decks.</p>
<p>The sharpers had made no false moves. The cards
had most certainly been well examined by Saidee
Isaacs and the Russian. They were a popular back,
extremely hard to mark. The trick, if trick there was,
lay in the smoked-glasses worn by Harry Raymond!</p>
<p>Satisfied of this fact, Fay started around the deck in
order to divert suspicion from himself. One or two
<!-- 218.png-->
passengers had passed him while he was peering through
the port-hole.</p>
<p>He reached the great bay of the combined bridge and
pilot-house. A fog was sweeping in from the sea. It
lay over the plunging bow of the ship like a blanket at
the foot of a bed. Toward this murky veil the course
was being held.</p>
<p>A man, wrapped in a pea-jacket, came down a ladder
swiftly, squinted at a yellow tissue, then started along
the starboard side of the ship. Fay realized it was the
captain, although the braid on his cap was inconspicuous.</p>
<p>He followed him until he reached a midship boat.
He stood in the shelter of this and saw a steward come
forward. The two men, dimly discerned under the
yellow glow of the overhead deck-lights, were pointing
toward a cabin door. Fay started with surprise. It
was his own door!</p>
<p>The steward tried the brass-knob, rapped once, bent
his head and listened with his left ear to the panel.
He straightened and shook his head as the captain
struck the tissue with impatient knuckles.</p>
<p>An oath in Norwegian rolled along the ship. Fay
came out from the shadow of the boat and sauntered
forward. He rounded the bay of the pilot-house and
hurried aft without glancing back. He stood, finally,
at the rail which overlooked the stern of the vessel.</p>
<p>His brain worked swiftly and toward one point.
The captain had received a wireless message. The
message concerned himself. For no other reason would
the steward have knocked on the door of the cabin.</p>
<p>The context of this message might prove
<!-- 219.png-->
embarrassing. Scotland Yard had a long arm. It had
dragged him out of a Dartmoor cell. It had pressed
him on in the mission to Holland. Now, perhaps, it
was reaching again, and this time for revenge and deeper
incarceration.</p>
<p>Fay smiled with thin bitterness. He was on the eve
of a discovery. The captain might make an arrest
at any moment. Visions of chains and “brigs” and
well-guarded cabins came to him. He stared forward
where he had last seen the captain.</p>
<p>The fog had been reached. It wreathed the ship
in clammy folds. The spars, the rails, the outswung
boats, the white life-preservers, were dripping with
yellow drops. The siren blared its warning signal.
The knife-like bow of the ship slit through the curtain
like a sabre through cloth.</p>
<p>Hurtling onward, the ship seemed a shadow within
a shadow. The hissing waves under the counter, the
thrash of the single screw, the clank of shovels on the
stoke-hold plates— heard through the ventilators—all
drove a resolve within Fay’s breast. He cursed
the day he had ever heard of the cipher or the cipher-key.
He wanted freedom and a shielding distance
away from the menacing hand of the Yard. He decided
to crawl into a life-boat, draw the tarpaulin, and
remain there until he could signal to Saidee Isaacs.
He reached upward and lifted himself to the blocks of
the after port boat whose davits were swung outboard.</p>
<p>The stiff canvas was laced by stout rope-yarn. It
would have to be cut in order to lift a flap sufficiently
large enough to crawl through. He reached for his
<!-- 220.png-->
knife. He turned his head at a sound which was blown
from forward. He sprang down and leaned over the
rail in an attitude of deep contemplation of the sea and
fog.</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs glided to his side. She pressed her
hat against his cap as she said tersely:</p>
<p>“I only got away from the game for a minute. I
can’t make it out. Here’s a deck of the cards which
we were using. Look them over, Chester. They seem
all right. I have got to put the deck back or it will be
missed.”</p>
<p>“<i>His</i> glasses?” asked Fay. “What kind are they?
I couldn’t see from the port-hole.”</p>
<p>“They’re very thick and smoky.” Saidee Isaacs
glanced apprehensively forward. “They’re thick,
Chester. I can hardly see his eyes through them. He
said that they had been weakened by a mustard-gas
attack at Ypres.”</p>
<p>Fay rapidly scanned the back of the cards, then
turned them over and held them toward the light from
a deck-bulb.</p>
<p>“He never was nearer Ypres than London or Calais,”
he said, shuffling the deck by a practiced motion.
“He’s an awful liar!”</p>
<p>The girl clutched his sleeve and narrowed her dark
eyes. “Hurry!” she said. “Is there anything wrong
with the cards? He’s won three hundred pounds from
that Russian. How does he do it?”</p>
<p>Fay bunched the cards and ran his fingers over their
edges. He replaced them in the box and handed the
box back to the girl.
<!-- 221.png--></p>
<p>“I don’t know,” he said, glancing squarely at her.
“There’s nothing wrong with the cards—no edge-work,
no marking on the back, no pin-pricks. The
light’s good here. I didn’t see a thing wrong. It’s
in the glasses he wears.”</p>
<p>She started away and toward the bow.</p>
<p>“Wait!”</p>
<p>She grasped the rail and turned. “What is it?”
she asked. “I must hurry back. It was my dummy—that’s
why I came.”</p>
<p>Fay reached in his pocket and whipped out a cigarette.
He lighted it with cool fingers holding the
match. He jerked his head toward the pilot-house
and the fog-wreathed bow.</p>
<p>“The captain has a wireless message of some kind.
He tried to find me in my cabin. The steward knocked.
They’re looking over the ship for me now. Something
has gone wrong. They wouldn’t do that unless there
was a rumble.”</p>
<p>“Rumble?”</p>
<p>“Yes! I’m discovered! The Yard has wirelessed
the ship. We were trailed aboard—you and I.”</p>
<p>“It can’t be, Chester.”</p>
<p>“It’s true! There’s no other reason for the skipper’s
looking for me. He’ll probably lock me up if he finds
me. I’m going to hide in this boat. You find out
what you can about the smoked-glasses. I’ll stay
here till you come back.”</p>
<p>She twisted the deck of cards in her fingers and narrowed
her eyes. Her lips hardened slightly. Anxiety
showed in the corners of her mouth.
<!-- 222.png--></p>
<p>“Are you sure?” she asked.</p>
<p>“Certain! Get back to the game. Don’t excite
any suspicion. Find out what you can and keep me
posted. We’re pals! I’m not going to stand for a
pinch—if I can help it. You can give out later that
I jumped overboard. I’ll leave some clothes on the
deck. MacKeenon is not going to get me back to
London. My one chance is to hide until you get the
information concerning the glasses from Harry Raymond.
Then we can breathe easier.”</p>
<p>“Get into the boat,” she whispered. “Stay there
till I come. I did see the captain and a steward looking
around the Ladies’ Saloon.”</p>
<p>“You better not go back then.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I must; perhaps I’ll discover the secret of
glasses,” said Saidee Isaacs.</p>
<p>Fay waited until she had vanished in the mist. He
reached upward for a second time, grasped a block
and sprang to the rail. He cut two strands of rope-yarn,
unreaved it, and climbed within the outswung
boat. He drew close the flap of canvas. There were
a water-keg and a box of ship’s biscuits, crammed among
a full set of oars and paddles. He moved about and
found a reclining place. He pillowed his head on a
cross-seat which was as hard as the shelf he slept on
in Dartmoor.</p>
<p>Time passed—perhaps thirty minutes. He had
no mark of the hour. He puzzled his brain for some
way out of the situation. There seemed none. The
captain was most certainly searching for him. The
stewards and deck-stewards had been notified.
<!-- 223.png-->
The wireless operator was undoubtedly in touch
with the shore stations as well as with Great
Britain.</p>
<p>The ship would touch at Stavanger for a brief period.
It would be daylight or nearly so, unless the fog
thickened. Fay saw scant chance of getting ashore.
He had the silver greyhound, but this insignia might
prove an identification mark instead of a passport.</p>
<p>The monotonous blare of the fog-horn, forward, and
the occasional blast from the deep-throated siren
held his nerves at the breaking strain. He was cramped,
cold and bitter. Footsteps along the deck served to
irritate him. He wanted to smoke and feared the
consequences.</p>
<p>There came a tap of a thrown object upon the canvas
boat-cover. He waited and heard a mellow voice
reciting:</p>
<div class="poetry i">
“Thy towers, they say, gleam fair—<br>
Bombay across the deep, blue sea.”
</div>
<p>He lifted the canvas flap and peered out. Saidee
Isaacs was leaning over the rail. She glanced upward
and bobbed the feathers of her hat.</p>
<p>Fay climbed out of the boat and sprang down to her
side.</p>
<p>“Well?” he asked incisively.</p>
<p>“He’s in his cabin, now. The game broke up when
the Russian turned over his last kopeck. He had
some pearls, but your friend Harry didn’t want them.
I never saw such a game of Bridge in my life!”</p>
<p>Fay stared at her lips. A fine smile of retrospection
<!-- 224.png-->
was upon them. The droop to her eyes was inscrutable.
She flushed suddenly and turned from the rail.</p>
<p>“You’ll have to be careful,” she said warningly.
“The stewards are looking for someone. They’ve
been everywhere. I saw a man standing in front of
your door. He’s waiting!”</p>
<p>Fay glanced up at the boat. “What about the
smoked-glasses?” he asked.</p>
<p>“They’re still smoked! I never saw his eyes. He’s
a deep one. I tried to talk to him after we left the
saloon. He said ‘Good-night, old dear,’ and left me.”</p>
<p>“But you found out something?”</p>
<p>“Not a thing, Chester. He simply knew every
single card in the game. He saw right through them.
He is the most terrible man on the ocean. I lost—”</p>
<p>“How much?” asked Fay as he waited for her to
finish.</p>
<p>“I lost thirty-two or three pounds. The Russian
bet on the side. That’s how he happened to pull out
the pearls.”</p>
<p>“What cabin is Raymond in?”</p>
<p>“It’s on this deck—about midships. The awful
cockney is next door to him. What are you going to
do?”</p>
<p>Fay gripped her arm. “I’m going to have it out
with him,” he said. “I’ll stick him up and get the
glasses. They have some property of revealing what
ordinary eyes cannot see. How else could he read the
backs of the cards? How else can the cipher be read?”</p>
<p>She bobbed her head and fastened upon him the
fine scrutiny of a pal-in-arms. He studied her keenly
<!-- 225.png-->
and then glanced over her shoulder. The fog blotted
out all view of the sea and stars. The ship was plunging
on toward Stavanger. The deck, as far as he could
see, was deserted. It glistened in a long lane of shining
moisture.</p>
<p>Suddenly she asked:</p>
<p>“Did he wear smoked-glasses when you knew him
in the old days?”</p>
<p>“No—his eyes were as good as mine, Saidee.”</p>
<p>“How long ago was that?”</p>
<p>“Five—six years. I saw him on a Blue Funnel
liner out of Southampton. He didn’t wear glasses
then.”</p>
<p>“It’s a new trick,” she said. “It’s uncanny.”</p>
<p>“Are they the same kind of lenses as were in the
pair I threw into the sea? The same bows and color?”</p>
<p>“The glass is the same—almost opaque! I didn’t
get a very good look at the ones you tossed away.”</p>
<p>“They were almost black. I guess they are the
same. We’ll have to get his pair if we want to appease
Sir Richard and the Yard. I’ll get into his cabin
and have it out with him. Perhaps he’ll tell me the
secret. If he don’t—”</p>
<p>Fay paused and closed his lips in a straight line.
His eyes swung forward and away from the girl. His
hand dropped to his pocket. It came out with the
tiny revolver nestled in his palm.</p>
<p>“If he don’t,” he continued, “I’ll use this gun. I
think he’s yellow when it comes to a scare.”</p>
<p>“The cabin door may be locked.”</p>
<p>“You go and knock. Tell him who it is. I’ll break
<!-- 226.png-->
in as soon as he opens the door. You can stand guard
while I get the glasses. Afterwards doesn’t matter.
It’s now or never, Saidee! My freedom may depend
on getting those glasses. Something is going to happen
on this ship. They’re looking very sharply for me,
and you know what that means.”</p>
<p>“Dartmoor?”</p>
<p>“Yes! Sir Richard and his jackals have picked up
the trail. They could hardly miss it. We were careless
at Arendal. We booked passage on this ship,
after showing the silver greyhound. Any clerk would
remember this.” Fay fingered the insignia on his left
lapel. “There’s not many like it,” he added.</p>
<p>“Take it off.”</p>
<p>“No, I’ll stick to it. It may serve, yet.”</p>
<p>She glanced forward along the deck. Turning
toward him, she said:</p>
<p>“I have a few of the cards with me. The Russian
tore up a deck in his rage at losing. I’ll lead the way
to the cabin. When I cough—you come.”</p>
<p>He followed her forward with his hand gripped upon
the butt of the little silver-plated revolver. The
cabins occupied by Harry Raymond and his cockney
tool were upon the deck below the boat deck. Saidee
Isaacs turned at a ladder, grasped the hand-rail, and
went down backwards—like a good sailor.</p>
<p>The deck they both reached was misted and deserted.
Four bells had struck, forward. The lights were out
in the saloons. The lookouts and watch on deck were
crouched in the shelter of the ventilators and boats.</p>
<p>Saidee glided swiftly over the planks, stared at a
<!-- 227.png-->
number upon a cabin-door, then stepped to the next.
She knocked with light tapping. She repeated the
signal. She bent her head and listened. Fay braced
himself behind a ladder and waited. He saw her
straighten suddenly. The cabin door was slid open.
A man, in pajamas and slippers, thrust his head out
and stared at her.</p>
<p>“Get them up!” said Fay, springing toward the door.
“All the way up, Harry, alias Ace-in-the-hole, alias
some other things. I want to see you! Look out,
Saidee.”</p>
<p>Fay was the master of the hour. He took no chances.
The tiny revolver was thrust up and under the sharper’s
chin. The level eyes of the cracksman snapped dangerously.
Blue light seemed to leap from their depths.</p>
<p>“What to hell?” stuttered the cardsharper. “What
does this mean?” he added, forgetting his English
drawl.</p>
<p>“It means, come clean!”</p>
<p>“Clean of what?”</p>
<p>“Those glasses you are wearing!” Fay pressed his
left hand against the pink expanse of the sharper’s
shoulder and shoved him back into the cabin.</p>
<p>“Stand watch!” he said to Saidee Isaacs. “Let me
know if anybody shows up on the deck.”</p>
<p>He sprang inside the cabin and towered over the
swindler, who had fallen back to the bunk in a shivering
protest. Fay darted a glance about the cabin. It was
simple enough. A wash-stand was built in the corner.
There was a long, flat trunk under the bunk. Clothes
and a cap hung on the back of a half-stool, half-chair.
<!-- 228.png--></p>
<p>“Where’s the smoked-glasses?” asked Fay. “Where
did you plant them? I want them in three seconds,
Harry. One!”</p>
<p>The sharper moistened his lips and glanced out
through the cabin door. The girl stood there in an
attitude of listening. Her face was turned forward
and over the port quarter. Her eyes glowed with
suppressed fire. A shout had sounded from the pilot-house.
The wheel had been swung as much as three
degrees. The ship had reeled and then darted on
through the folds of the sea fog.</p>
<p>Fay warily turned and stared at the girl. He stepped
toward the door. A shot, muffled and far to the
southward, boomed through the night. It was repeated
with sullen tones. The ship was signaled to
stop!</p>
<p>A door opened next to the cabin occupied by Harry
Raymond. The cockney thrust out a long nose and
a curious pair of eyes. He stared first out and over
the ship’s rail. He turned his head and blinked at
Saidee Isaacs. He saw Fay’s alert form in the doorway.
Recognizing him, he ducked back into his own
cabin and drew shut the door.</p>
<p>“A fine pal,” said the cracksman, brandishing the
revolver. “You picked a nice one, Harry. Come
clean with the glasses or I’ll count two and then three.”</p>
<p>“I haven’t got them,” stuttered the sharper.
“Honest to God, Fay, they’re in the other cabin. Old
Vic has them. I let him keep them after a game.
Y’ never can tell how people will squeak.”</p>
<p>Fay shot a keen glance at the man’s face. It was
<!-- 229.png-->
the color of dough—and blue-veined. Fear and
weakness had loosened his lips. His teeth showed
under a tawny mustache. His hands clutched the
edge of the bunk. His knees knocked together.</p>
<p>“You’re lying!” snapped Fay.</p>
<p>“I’m not, pal. I wouldn’t lie to you. Cocky has
the glasses.”</p>
<p>“What’s the trick? How do you read the cards
with them?”</p>
<p>The sharper hesitated. He was on the point of
speaking when a third shot echoed through the fog.
A solid projectile screeched over the white boats on
the hurricane-deck of the ship. A shudder passed
from stem to stern. The great vessel had reversed
its propeller. Saidee leaned aft and Fay was thrown
against the side of the cabin. Shouting and the hoarse
orders of the mates resounded. The fog was ripped in
one place to port. Through the gap the fine prow and
the belching funnels of a British destroyer of the superclass
leaped. She bore down and rounded the ship’s
bow like a skater on ice. Four flags were flung to her
bridge signal-halliards. A callow lieutenant-commander
in oil-skins and a sou’wester held a battered
speaking-trumpet to his beardless lips. Beside him
stood a man in a plaid overcoat and cap.</p>
<p>The ship came to a stop with a popping of safety-valves
and steam pluming from the pipe aft her funnel.
The captain leaned from the ledge of the wheel-house,
grasped a stay, and shouted to the lieutenant who had
skillfully maneuvered the destroyer to a point on the
port waist after rounding the ship’s stern.
<!-- 230.png--></p>
<p>“What do you want?” rolled over the waves.</p>
<p>The lieutenant lowered his speaking-trumpet and
turned to the man in the plaid overcoat. They both
were bathed in the yellow light which streamed from
the actinic fog-projector mounted on top of the pilot-house
of the ship.</p>
<p>The commander of the destroyer turned, wiped the
dripping end of his trumpet with a bare palm, and
shouted:</p>
<p>“We want two of your passengers. You got our
wireless? We had hell—finding you. You know the
two?”</p>
<p>“The woman is here!” hoarsely boomed the captain.
“We can’t find the man, yet.”</p>
<p>The lieutenant turned to the figure at his side.
They both dipped and rose with the movement of the
destroyer. The crew were on deck. Faces appeared
at the head of the engine-room companion. Two forms
crouched at the seven-inch bow gun.</p>
<p>“I’m coming aboard!” shouted the commander.
“Hold your headway—no more! Give her quarter
speed! We’ll see about that fellow!”</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs grasped Fay’s sleeve. “Get into the
boat,” she said, pointing toward the ladder which led
to the upper deck. “Hurry, Chester!”</p>
<p>Fay pocketed the revolver, shot a final glance at
the mute figure of the sharper in the cabin, then he
leaped for the ladder. Up this he went until he had
reached the upper-deck. He started aft, keeping in the
shelter of the boats and ventilators. He stopped and
drew himself into a narrow alley-way.
<!-- 231.png--></p>
<p>Three seamen were casting off a bo’swain’s ladder.
They turned and stared forward as the mate and the
captain loomed through the gloom.</p>
<p>A spot-light from the destroyer swung over the ship’s
upper rails and brought out every detail.</p>
<p>“Here he is,” said the first officer. “Yes, this is
the man we want.”</p>
<p>Fay bowed as he stepped from the alley-way. “What
do you want with me?” he asked.</p>
<p>The captain pointed toward the destroyer with a
steady finger.</p>
<p>“They want you,” he said heavily. “England wants
you for some reason. The war is over, but England
rules <i>this</i> sea. I’ve got to give you up—young
fellow.”</p>
<p>“It’s an outrage!” said Fay. “This is a Norwegian
ship. I claim the protection of your flag.”</p>
<p>The captain motioned for the crew to lower the
bo’swain’s ladder. “The lieutenant-commander will
be aboard presently,” he said. “You can talk to
him. You’re a King’s messenger, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>Fay showed the silver greyhound by turning back
the flap of his overcoat.</p>
<p>“Who is the lady?” asked the captain, fishing in
the side-pocket of his pea-jacket and bringing forth
a yellow wireless tissue. “This says a woman and a
man who wears the insignia of the King’s couriers.
She’s the one in the hat with purple feathers—isn’t
she?”</p>
<p>“You’ll have to ask her,” said Fay, loyally. “I
claim your full protection!”
<!-- 232.png--></p>
<p>The captain replaced the tissue and leaned upon the
rail. A small-boat, which had been nested with others
on the gray flush-deck of the destroyer, was dancing
over the waves. In the stern of this boat the lieutenant
and the man in the plaid overcoat sat. Two
seamen bent to the oars. The boat reached the ladder.
It lifted and fell. It steadied as the commander
leaped the distance and grasped the lower end of the
ladder. The silent man followed him nimbly enough.
They came over the rail.</p>
<p>Fay moved forward and stared into the man’s face.
He recognized MacKeenon.</p>
<p>“Weil,” said the inspector, “this is a deep pleasure.
Ye should o’ expected me about this time. Why,
mon, the trail ye left was a verra broad one! A hae
no doot ye thought ye were clever.”</p>
<p>Fay gulped and glanced at the lieutenant-commander.
“By what right,” he asked, “does this man take me
from this ship? I’m an American!”</p>
<p>“Five years in Dartmoor,” said MacKeenon dryly.
“A’ hae no doot it’ll be that many more. Did ye
get what ye went after?”</p>
<p>The question was shot through thin lips. The
pouches on the sides of the inspector’s jaw distended
and contracted. He bared his gums like a wise old
hound. His eyes narrowed to slits.</p>
<p>“Did ye get it?” he repeated as his arm shot out and
clutched the cracksman’s shoulder.</p>
<p>Fay jerked away and turned. Some of the passengers
had come forward and were curiously staring
at him. Others peered out from the open doors of
<!-- 233.png-->
staterooms. A bo’swain stood near by, with a long
belaying-pin. He toyed with this weapon suggestively.</p>
<p>“I got it!” said Fay, turning back to MacKeenon.
“Oh, yes, I got it! I got what you sent me for. You
know I got it!”</p>
<p>“So does the police of that city—south and east
of here. Why mon, ye made a terrible job of it. A
could have done better myself. A was surprised, after
what I expected of you. Fortunately A had that stick
o’ mine handy, or else they’d of caught ye red-handed.”</p>
<p>Fay smiled with engaging warmth. “Thanks for
that,” he said. “It was a good turn, but it deserved
a better. What reason have I to leave this ship?
Suppose I open my mouth and tell what I know.”</p>
<p>“Ye’ll never do that!” snapped MacKeenon cautiously.
“Ye’ll never squeal—A know that to be a
fact. Come on now, Chester, with me. Get your
luggage and come on. You’re under arrest!”</p>
<p>The inspector threw back his coat and showed the
gold insignia of Scotland Yard. He dropped his coat
lapel and pointed a steady finger toward the destroyer
whose deck was directly beneath the great ship’s
rail.</p>
<p>“Come on, mon!” he ordered.</p>
<p>“He’ll not go!”</p>
<p>MacKeenon turned and stared forward. Saidee
Isaacs had thrust herself through the curious passengers.
She glided to Fay’s side and repeated her
declaration:</p>
<p>“He’ll not go!”</p>
<p>“What—twa o’ them,” MacKeenon said softly.
<!-- 234.png-->
“Twa suspects on one boat. Captain, A hae the honor
of arresting them both. The lieutenant will show his
authority from the Admiralty. It was signed only
yesterday. A weary stretch of ocean we have come
over. It was only by chance we held your course in
the fog. A was on the point of requesting the officer
to proceed to Stavanger.”</p>
<p>The captain saw no way out of the difficulty. He
turned to Fay and said with salty vigor:</p>
<p>“Get your luggage and do as they request. I’ll
report the matter to my government. England is
mistress of these seas by the terms of the peace treaties.
I can’t hold my boat any longer.”</p>
<p>“You’re a coward!” said Saidee Isaacs, stamping her
foot on the deck. “This man has done nothing.”</p>
<p>“Weil! Weil!” MacKeenon chuckled. “Miss Isaacs
has changed a wee bit since last A saw her. She was
willing to help trap a cracksman and now she’s rounded
on the Yard. A’y’l attend to her!”</p>
<p>The girl turned swiftly to Fay. “We have no
luggage,” she said. “We’ll go! But never a word
will we say. Remember, Chester, I will say nothing
without you being present. Remember that!”</p>
<p>“A verra clever remark,” intonated MacKeenon.
“Twa thieves are far worse than one.”</p>
<p>Fay followed the girl to the rail where the bo’swain’s
ladder was lashed. He assisted her to climb down
until he was forced to let go her hands. Her upturned
face was close to his as he leaned over the
rail. Her eyes were loyal and smouldering with rage
toward MacKeenon. Her cheeks flushed through the
<!-- 235.png-->
olive-hue of her skin. Her lips were set and almost
hard. She flashed a sudden smile, and, turning her
head, glanced downward to where the seamen of the
destroyer had maneuvered the small-boat. They
grappled the ladder with a boat-hook. She waited
and sprang outward. She landed in the stern and
grasped the gunwale. She stared upward with concern
as Fay descended the swaying ladder.</p>
<p>He reached her side and waited. MacKeenon and
the lieutenant-commander came down the ladder and
leaped for the bow of the boat. It was shoved away
from the rusty sheer of the giant ship. A bell clanged
as the captain hurried forward along the upper rail.
The screw thrashed the waves. The ship surged on.
Its stern showed with gold letters marking the name:</p>
<p>“<i>Drammen of Stavanger.</i>”</p>
<p>It was gone in a swelter of foam and funnel smoke.
The fog closed about the last of the deck lights. The
sea tossed the small-boat like a cork in a whirlpool.</p>
<p>“Steady her!” said the lieutenant-commander,
smartly. “Hold steady! Out boat-hook! Catch
that chain!”</p>
<p>The destroyer glided through the fog like a lean
serpent. A white bone was at its prow. A bell jingled.
An order rolled over the sea. The three screws reversed
as the seaman reached upward and caught a
dangling anchor chain. The boat was drawn close to
the flush-deck. It was worked aft until a low ladder
was reached.</p>
<p>“After you!” said MacKeenon through cupped
hands as he raised himself in the bow and turned
<!-- 236.png-->
toward Saidee Isaacs and Fay. “Climb aboard!
Ye’ll be verra welcome!”</p>
<p>The girl was assisted up the ladder by the strong
arm of an ensign who wore a gold-braided cap and
greasy dungarees. Fay followed her. They stood
clutching the hand-rail which rose from well-scoured
duck-boards on the starboard waist.</p>
<p>“Remember, Chester,” said Saidee Isaacs as
MacKeenon scrambled out of the small-boat. “Remember,
we’ll say nothing until we see Sir Richard.
He’s more of a man than MacKeenon.”</p>
<p>“They’re all the same,” said Fay, bitterly.

<h2 title="XIV. The House of the Lions" id="chXIV">
<span style="font-size:1.2em;">CHAPTER XIV</span><br><span style="font-size:1.1em">THE HOUSE OF THE LIONS</span>
</h2>
<p>However much Fay had expected the brig and irons,
he was mistaken in both surmises.</p>
<p>The lieutenant-commander of the destroyer and
MacKeenon were openly solicitous regarding their
captives’ welfare. The cabin assigned to Saidee Isaacs
was just off the ward-room. It had been used by an
Admiral during the years of the war. It was fitted
with the simple, serviceable things which are found
on all his Majesty’s better ships—running hot and
cold water in bath and wash-stand—a bed instead of
a bunk—white walls and cork-tiled deck.</p>
<p>Fay was shown an ensign’s cabin which had recently
been vacated. He turned as he felt the powerful
throbbing of the giant engines of the destroyer.
MacKeenon stood in the doorway with his legs braced
across the alley-way. The Scotch detective smiled
dryly and regarded the pockets of Fay’s overcoat with
concern.</p>
<p>“A hae no doot,” he said, “that ye are armed.
Mind passing over any wicked thing in that direction?
There’s much powder about.”</p>
<p>Fay dipped his right hand into his pocket and passed
to MacKeenon the little silver-plated revolver which
Saidee Isaacs had given to him. The inspector snapped
<!-- 238.png-->
it open and dropped the cartridges into the palm of
his right hand. “A better keep these,” he suggested.
“Any more, Chester?”</p>
<p>“Nothing,” said Fay.</p>
<p>“Now the package ye got from the embassy’s safe.”
The request was almost cheerful as if the inspector
expected no trouble at all in this connection. Fay
stared at him and shook his head.</p>
<p>“I have no package,” he said.</p>
<p>“What, mon—no packet! Ye made considerable
mess of the safe in Holland. A hear from reliable
sources that ye took the outer door, the day door and
the inner box like a blacksmith.”</p>
<p>Fay removed his overcoat, tossed his cap on the
bunk, then stepped toward MacKeenon.</p>
<p>“You can search me,” he offered. “I didn’t bungle
that job—as you think. I’m not going to talk with
you until I see Sir Richard. I may be misquoted.
You well know that anything I say may be used
against me.”</p>
<p>MacKeenon straightened himself, waited until the
leaping destroyer had taken the downswing of a long
glide, then he tapped Fay’s pockets with professional
concern. He finished with the overcoat and the cap.
His lips wore a puzzled expression as he stepped back
through the door.</p>
<p>“Ye gave the package to the girl?” he asked.</p>
<p>“See her! I’ll not talk and I don’t think she will.
I got what I was sent after!”</p>
<p>“Ye got it! Where is it?”</p>
<p>“In London—where Sir Richard is—I shall
<!-- 239.png-->
explain everything. Up to that time and place,
questions are useless, Mac.”</p>
<p>The inspector sniffed and ran his keen eyes over the
cabin. He turned and glanced up the alley-way.</p>
<p>“Come on deck when ye want to,” he said softly.
“Ye’ll find oil-skins and boots in the ward-room.
We’re slithering toward the North o’ England at a
tremendous rate. We’ll be there, this time tomorrow.
A’y’ll give ye that long to think things over.”</p>
<p>Fay watched him disappear toward the bow of the
destroyer. He sat down and lowered his face in his
hands. The noises of their swift passage drove out all
thoughts of escape. There were many alert men on
the boat. Discipline was stern and thorough. The
trap had been well sprung. It was the first stage of
the journey back to Dartmoor.</p>
<p>He reviewed the series of events. It seemed that
he had been gripped by a relentless urging since the
hour MacKeenon had stood in that stone-lined
courtyard at Dartmoor. There flashed over his brain
the swirl and surge of affairs. He thought of every
little detail—the cipher papers—the coming of
Dutch Gus—the package in the embassy’s safe—the
smoked-glasses.</p>
<p>But one phase of the matter was illuminating. The
others were blurred and destroying. Saidee Isaacs
had cleared herself in a satisfactory manner. She was
shown up in loyal colors. He no longer had any
doubt of her.</p>
<p>He rose, thrust his arms in the sleeves of his coat,
and pulled his cap down over his head. He glanced
<!-- 240.png-->
into a tiny mirror. His beard on chin and upper lip
showed prominently. He had not shaved for days.
There was a fighting light in his eyes, however, which
had always been with him.</p>
<p>“I’m not beat!” he declared as he passed out the
cabin and into a narrow, steel-lined alley-way. “I’ll
find Saidee and talk things over.”</p>
<p>The alley-way terminated at a ladder which led to
the deck. Flanking this ladder, to port and starboard,
were two closed doors. Fay went up and lifted a
hatch. He staggered to the duck-boards and gripped
an iron railing. He glanced about with his eyes
widening at the wilderness of water and fog and
spindrift.</p>
<p>The super-destroyer was knifing westward like a
hurtled javelin. Her four funnels belched fire and
oily smoke. Her superstructure of nested boats,
ventilators, pilot-house, chart-house, battened guns
and two taper signal-masts vibrated and throbbed
under the steady hammering of the high-speed engines.</p>
<p>The dawn was breaking to the eastward. A yellow
light was on the fog. A sea bird wheeled and fell
astern. A great wave curled the sharp bow, combed
the flush decks and seethed to leeward.</p>
<p>Fay wound his fingers about the rail and turned
until he faced the after part of the destroyer. A few
of the crew were on deck. They crouched in the lee
of shelters. The stern gun had a jaunty tilt to its long
muzzle. A mark showed on the sponson where a
German shell had exploded.</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs appeared in oil-skins and a yellow
<!-- 241.png-->
southwester. She was followed by the lean form of
MacKeenon. They worked forward and stood by
Fay’s side. They swayed with the movements of the
fast-flying destroyer.</p>
<p>“Yon is Scotland,” said MacKeenon. “Ye are in
the heart of the North Sea.”</p>
<p>“Where do we land?” asked Fay.</p>
<p>“The Firth o’ Tay—at Dundee or Perth.”</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs pulled down the brim of her southwester
and stared forward. She pressed her fingers
against Fay’s arm.</p>
<p>“We’ll be in London by tomorrow afternoon,” she
said warningly.</p>
<p>Fay nodded. He was helpless. There was no possible
escape from facing Sir Richard.</p>
<p>“A have sent a wireless,” said MacKeenon between
gusts of wind. “They will be expecting distinguished
guests,” he added dryly. “A warn ye both that if ye
have the cipher-key or know where it can be gotten—don’t
destroy it or cause it to be whisked away. It is
also the key to Dartmoor.”</p>
<p>“Then I’m gone,” thought Fay as he glanced at the
girl. She shook her head slightly. Her fingers uncoiled
from the rail. Her hand passed slowly over her mouth.
She had indicated silence without MacKeenon catching
the motion.</p>
<p>Fay dropped his eyes and glanced at the hatch.
“Let’s go below,” he said. “I’m getting wet and cold
up here. How about some breakfast, Mac?”</p>
<p>“Ye shall both be served,” said the Scot. “A shall
breakfast with ye both.”
<!-- 242.png--></p>
<p>The morning passed in the silence of the ward-room.
Afternoon deepened the light that came through the
port-holes. Green changed to opal, and opal to gray.
Fog swirled and wound the destroyer with a protecting
cloak. The speed was not reduced until the old
mine barrier was reached off the Scotch coast. A shot
gave the warning. Voices called from ship to ship.
Once the bright flare of a two-second light flashed and
was gone. They entered the Firth of Tay and glided
for the anchorage off Dundee.</p>
<p>“A quick passage,” was all that MacKeenon said
as the rattle of the anchor chain followed the shutting
down of the engines.</p>
<p>Fay waited in the ward-room as Saidee Isaacs went
for her hat and gloves. She returned within a minute.
She stood erect and faced the Scot as two ensigns came
down through the companion and saluted.</p>
<p>“Ye go with us,” said the inspector. “There shall
be a mon or twa waiting in Dundee. Passage has been
booked for the south. A think it will be long after
midnight when we board the Royal Scotsman for London.
A hae no doot ye’ll thank the commander for
me.”</p>
<p>The ensigns stared at the girl admiringly. They
saluted and started up the ladder which led to the
deck. Fay preceded Saidee Isaacs. MacKeenon
waited discreetly, then climbed rapidly upward. The
group stood on the dark deck of the destroyer. Lights
showed where ships rode at anchor. A diadem of fire
rimmed the quays and water front. A hotel added its
glow over the city’s housetops. All this was a glimpse
<!-- 243.png-->
of England to Fay. He turned as he heard a metallic
sound. MacKeenon had opened a pair of handcuffs.
They clicked softly upon the cracksman’s protesting
right wrist.</p>
<p>“A can take no chances,” apologized the vigilant
inspector.</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs started. She wheeled with flaming
cheeks and glowing eyes toward the inspector.</p>
<p>“Take them off!” she exclaimed hotly. “What do
you mean?”</p>
<p>MacKeenon carefully gripped the loose end of the cuffs
and felt to see if Fay’s wrist was clamped tight enough.</p>
<p>“A have my orders,” he said craftily.</p>
<p>“From whom?” The girl’s voice was tense and
demanding.</p>
<p>“From the Yard. A can do nothing else than what
A’ve done. In the train A’y’ll take them off. A shall
take them off.”</p>
<p>“Never mind,” said Fay slowly. “He’s got some
kind of a warrant. I’m on parole—you know.”</p>
<p>MacKeenon chuckled and snapped his eyes. “Ye
are that,” he said, “and here comes the boat. Step
this way, Chester.”</p>
<p>A whale-boat rowed by two sailors glided alongside
the flush-deck of the destroyer. The seamen upended
oars and reached for a grating. They waited.</p>
<p>MacKeenon, with Fay in tow, led the way over the
duck-boards and down a flat ladder to the boat. He
stepped aft and made room on the stern seat for the
cracksman. Saidee Isaacs sprang aboard and glided
to the bow. The two ensigns stood at attention.
<!-- 244.png-->
They saluted as the sailors shoved off and started
rowing.</p>
<p>The shore was reached at a Government quay,
piled high with North Sea stores. An auto was standing
at the head of the quay. The driver blew three
blasts on his horn. MacKeenon answered the signal
by raising his hand. A man came gliding between
the boxes and bales and stared at Fay. He turned
toward MacKeenon.</p>
<p>“A’ve booked a compartment on the Royal Scotsman,”
he said like an inferior to a superior. “Ye
should reach London by noon. Sir Richard has wired
me he will be waiting at the House of the Two Lions.”</p>
<p>“Scotland Yard,” whispered Saidee Isaacs into Fay’s
ear.</p>
<p>MacKeenon caught the sly aside and smiled like a
crafty manhunter.</p>
<p>“A hae no doot it is,” he said, staring at Saidee
Isaacs. “It’s a quiet branch of the Criminal Investigation
Division.”</p>
<p>The inspector led the way to the waiting motor.
The drive to the station was made in silence. A wait
ensued as the Dundee detective went within the train-shed
and arranged for the compartment. He came
back rubbing his dry hands. He nodded toward
MacKeenon.</p>
<p>“Ye go through a side door,” he said. “A’y’ll
follow ye—to see that ye get there. A had a slip-up
in this spot once. My mon got clean away.”</p>
<p>The Scot glanced at Fay with a glitter in his eyes.
The cracksman shivered slightly. He could not help
<!-- 245.png-->
the movement. There was that to the inspector’s
which spoke of blood-hunting instincts bred in their
bones.</p>
<p>“They’re all the same,” he whispered to Saidee
Isaacs. “I told you they were all the same.”</p>
<p>She signaled caution and followed him through to
the train-shed. MacKeenon spoke to the guard. The
compartment was unlocked. They entered and sat
down.</p>
<p>The Dundee detective stood on the running-board
with his watch in hand and his eyes glued upon the
station-master, who wore more medals than a German
field marshal of Hohenzollern days.</p>
<p>“Ye’re off,” he announced, snapping shut his watch.
“A wish ye all a pleasant trip.”</p>
<p>The train pulled out of the long station and struck
across the city. It plunged into a covered bridge and
out upon highland. It took the switches and shunts
like a scared cat on a fence. It tunneled the fog and
the night—south-bound for Edinburgh and London.</p>
<p>MacKeenon reached and tried both doors of the
compartment. He turned, fished into his vest pocket,
and brought forth a tiny key.</p>
<p>“A’y’ll take off the darbies, now,” he said, slipping
the key into the barrel lock of the handcuffs. “Ye
can rest easier.”</p>
<p>“It <i>is</i> about time!” declared Saidee Isaacs as she
pressed herself into a corner of the leather cushions
and pulled her hat down over her eyes.</p>
<p>Fay examined his wrist with concern. A red band
showed there. He worked his fingers, stared at them,
<!-- 246.png-->
then brought forth a cigarette from his pocket and,
declining the light offered by MacKeenon, struck his
own match upon the bottom of his heel.</p>
<p>Dawn crimsoned the drawn shades of the compartment.
The guard appeared at a station and took the
inspector’s orders for a basket of rather frugal proportions.
The three ate breakfast in silence. The
last scrap was finished by MacKeenon, who remarked
dryly:</p>
<p>“Three and six! A minds the time when it was two
and four.”</p>
<p>Fay took this statement to mean that the inspector
had spent rather more money than he expected for
the breakfast. He watched the thrifty Scot make an
entry in a notebook. His eyes wandered from this to
Saidee Isaacs. She had pressed her face to a window and
was peering out. She turned and held the shade up
for him.</p>
<p>He caught a streaky glimpse of English meadows
and estates. The trees were very green. The lawns
sloped down to the rails like great seas of velvet.
Hedges and well-trimmed clumps and flower-crescents
flickered by.</p>
<p>Fay flashed her a quick signal. He could escape!
MacKeenon might be bowled over. The door could
be broken open. There was all of the North Country
to hide in. A flying leap from the train would take him
from the grasping hand of the Yard. The girl shook
her head. She had a plan which she could not reveal
to him. She steadied her eyes and smiled a slow,
enigmatic smile of caution now, but freedom later.
<!-- 247.png--></p>
<p>MacKeenon glanced at his watch. It was evident
that the train would be late. This was such an unusual
thing for the Royal Scotsman that he made inquiry
of the guard as the great station at Peterborough was
reached.</p>
<p>The guard explained the matter by mentioning troop
movements back from France. The policing of Germany
consisted of a mere handful of the former
force.</p>
<p>It was graying dusk when the inspector rose and
brought out the handcuffs. Saidee Isaacs turned from
the window and flashed a protest as Fay’s wrist was
nipped and gyved to MacKeenon’s left hand.</p>
<p>She held her tongue and stood erect. The train
glided through the murk of a London station-yard.
Switch-point lights flashed—green and white. A roar
sounded of hollow sheds. A grinding of brakes announced
the last stop. The guard appeared, drew out
a great bunch of keys and unlocked the door. He
thrust his head inside.</p>
<p>“Hall hout!” he said. “They’re waiting for you,
inspector.”</p>
<p>Fay, on the end of a bright steel chain, followed the
detective. Saidee Isaacs, who might have dropped
back, stepped up loyally. The three hurried through
a curious crowd and glided out of a side door.</p>
<p>The same black car, with its H.M.S. plates, that had
brought Fay to London from Dartmoor, was waiting.
The same driver sat in the front seat. In the rear,
holding an inviting door, stood the little old man who
had followed the cracksman to Holland. His bundle
<!-- 248.png-->
lay on the seat. It was the nipper grip of the Yard—and
perfect team-work!</p>
<p>The ride south and then west through the crowded
throng of City clerks and busses was made in utter
silence. MacKeenon sat between Fay and the girl.
The little old man, whose eyes were as bright as a
terrier’s, watched everything. The pouches on the
sides of his jaw were leathern and long. He sniffed at
times. More times, he coughed with a distressing
rasp like a growl or a low bark.</p>
<p>The car turned into the street upon which was the
House of the Two Lions. The brakes went on with a
clamp. The throttle was slowed as the driver lifted
his foot from the pedal. He sprang out to the curb.
A smell of hot oil permeated the night air. A double
glow from two lamps illuminated the front of the house.
A man stood waiting!</p>
<p>Sir Richard nodded his head to MacKeenon after
the inspector had hurried Fay across the pavement
and up the flight of steps. The chief of the bureau
glanced keenly at Saidee Isaacs. He said nothing.
His manner was cold. His great jaw snapped shut.
It was like a double trap to Fay.</p>
<p>The light in the hallway was barely sufficient to
reveal a flight of stairs leading upward and a closed
door at the end. Toward this door Sir Richard stepped,
threw it open, and bowed as MacKeenon led his suspect
into the center of the huge room, where first
Fay had seen the cipher sheets.</p>
<p>The cracksman studied this room as MacKeenon,
at a nod from Sir Richard, rattled out the handcuff
<!-- 249.png-->
key and turned the bolt in the snap-lock. There were
the same three tin boxes upon the long mahogany
table. There was also evidence everywhere that
clerks had been copying the cipher. Five American
typewriters stood on tables at one end of the room.
The lights in the overhead cluster were brilliant.
The air tasted of pipe-smoke.</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs stood by the door which led to the
hallway. The little old man crept to her side and waited
for Sir Richard to speak. Fay leaned against the corner
of the long table and rubbed his wrist.</p>
<p>“You double-crossed me!” he exclaimed bitterly.
“You said I could go to Holland scot-free, and you’ve
had every Scotch inspector in the Yard after me.
How do you expect to get results if you do that?”</p>
<p>“Yes—how does he expect it?” said Saidee Isaacs.</p>
<p>Sir Richard stared from the girl to Fay. He brought
his lower lip over his upper one. His eyes were curtained
by his furrowed brows. His right-hand fingers
toyed with a watch-charm which hung from a heavy
gold chain.</p>
<p>Turning suddenly, he moved a chair behind the
table, sat down, leaned back, thrust his thumbs in
the arm-holes of his silk-lined vest and nodded toward
the door.</p>
<p>MacKeenon closed the door, locked it and came
back to Fay’s side. He passed the key toward Sir
Richard, who motioned for him to lay it on the table.</p>
<p>“Now that everybody has had their say,” said the
chief, with an icy glitter in his eyes. “Now that they
have,” he continued, “I suppose it’s my turn.”
<!-- 250.png--></p>
<p>“Fay, what did you do with the package you got
from the safe?”</p>
<p>The question was shot directly at the cracksman. It
was phrased so that there was no possible evasion.</p>
<p>It was a long minute before Fay answered. He laid
both palms on the table and leaned toward Sir Richard
as he said:</p>
<p>“What did I do with it—why, I threw it away!”</p>
<p>Sir Richard flushed hotly. He half rose from his
chair. His thumbs came out of the arm-pits of his
vest. He grasped the edge of the table and tilted his
chair forward.</p>
<p>“Threw it away! What did you do that for? You
got it and then threw it away?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I got it,” Fay said between rigid lips. “I got
what those German bunglers got—what Dutch Gus
was after. I got the package and threw it into the
North Sea. You sent me on a wild-goose chase—if
ever there was one.”</p>
<p>“How’s that?”</p>
<p>“How! Why, damn it man, I’m no fool! Here I go
after a strong-box, find that the outer door and the day
door is ripped wide-open by a bunch of blacksmiths,
beat them to the keister and get the package you
sent me for—only to find that the package contains
a cheap pair of smoked-glasses! A shilling pair, if
ever there was one!”</p>
<p>Fay paused and stood erect. He whipped off his
cap and, turning, glanced at Saidee Isaacs. She stepped
forward and nodded confirmation. Fay went on:</p>
<p>“You’ve been badly gulled, Sir Richard!
<!-- 251.png-->
Mononsonburg, whose name was on the package, must have left
the smoked-glasses at the embassy, and the report
got to your people, as well as to the Germans, that it
was the key to the cipher. I’m through with the whole
mess! Send me back to Dartmoor!”</p>
<p>“Smoked-glasses?” repeated Sir Richard, rising and
leaning over the table with his finger pointing like a
gun at Fay.</p>
<p>“Yes—smoked-glasses! An ordinary pair of ordinary
glasses!”</p>
<p>“And you threw them away?”</p>
<p>“Ask her,” said Fay, turning to the girl.</p>
<p>The chief of the investigation bureau sat back,
thrust his thumbs in his vest-holes, and whistled slowly.
He closed his pursed lips and glared across the polished
table. Inch by inch his eyes raised to the cracksman.
For the first time since leaving the prison, Fay felt
the grip of fear. There was that in the manhunter’s
eyes to warn him of coming danger.</p>
<p>He stepped back and away from the table. He came
full into the level squint of MacKeenon’s eyes. The
air of the great room grew tense with things about to
happen.</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs gripped Fay’s sleeve with a pressure
of confidence.</p>
<p>“Tell him everything,” she said in a low whisper.</p>
<p>MacKeenon stepped between the girl and Fay. He
clicked the handcuffs suggestively as he dropped a
hand into his coat pocket.</p>
<p>“Coom on,” he said, bringing out the cuffs.</p>
<p>“No, Mac!” Sir Richard snapped. “Not yet!
<!-- 252.png-->
The smoked-glasses he threw away interest me—the
trifle—lighter than air.”</p>
<p>Fay shrugged his narrow shoulders and advanced to
the table. He waited for Sir Richard to speak.</p>
<p>“Describe them,” said the chief, leaning back.
“What were those glasses like, Fay?”</p>
<p>“Ordinary! I saw nothing at all that would interest
you in them. They were dark—almost opaque. They
had cheap German-silver bows.”</p>
<p>“Where are they now?” Sir Richard’s voice held
the grating edge of an inquisitor’s.</p>
<p>“They’re in the North Sea off the Holland coast.
I’d say they went to the bottom in about thirty feet
of water. I threw them off a cliff. She knows.” Fay
turned toward Saidee Isaacs.</p>
<p>“He did, Sir Richard,” said the girl quickly. “He
and I were together. We had rowed ashore from a
sinking ship. I forget its name. Dutch Gus had the
package and Chester took it from him. He sank the
ship to get it.”</p>
<p>“Ah,” said the chief, “that was enterprise—at
<i>any</i> rate. Now where on the Holland coast could I
send a man to dive for the glasses?”</p>
<p>Fay glanced about the room. “If you get a good
chart I’ll show you,” he said.</p>
<p>Sir Richard rubbed his hands. “That’ll keep,” he
declared. “We’ll remember it, though. Now, Fay,
one other matter before I turn you over to MacKeenon.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“How did it happen that you went to Arendal?
What took you there?”
<!-- 253.png--></p>
<p>“I was trying to connect with a man named Harry
Raymond.”</p>
<p>“Ace-in-the-hole Harry?”</p>
<p>“Yes! The deep-sea cardsharper!”</p>
<p>“What did you want to meet him for?”</p>
<p>“Last time I saw him he wore a pair of glasses like
the pair I threw away on the Holland coast. Saidee
made me go after him—or suggested that I should.”</p>
<p>“No, it was his idea,” said the girl staunchly.</p>
<p>“Whoever thought of it,” Sir Richard said, “must
have been sure there was some connection between the
two pairs of glasses.”</p>
<p>Fay caught the deduction which had caused the
chief’s remark. He felt like a felon before a Crown’s
counsel. He bit his upper lip and toyed with his cap
which lay on the table. The bright cluster of bulbs
over his head brought out the clean-cut details of
Sir Richard’s features.</p>
<p>He realized that the man whom he faced was the
keenest ferret in all of Europe. The chief was balked,
but only temporarily. There was no beating him.
An inkling of the methods which had cost the underworld
so many of its choicest lights came to Fay. He
recalled that Foley the Goat had been caught by the
mere matter of losing a coat-button. Then there was
the Marble Arch affair, where Scotland Yard had
brought home the crime to its instigators by the
slender clue of five black hairs perfumed with a certain
Italian hair-tonic which only one shop in Soho
poured upon the heads of its customers.</p>
<p>Trifles had beaten the best-laid plans of those who
<!-- 254.png-->
lived beyond the law. And now the hounds were
snarling over another trifle—as Sir Richard said—lighter
than air. The chief had caught the thin wedge
between the two pairs of smoked-glasses. He had
guessed what Fay already knew. He glanced up at
the cracksman and smiled broadly.</p>
<p>“So your friend, Harry-in-the-hole, wore the same
kind of glasses? That simplifies matters. It may
solve the cipher for us!”</p>
<p>“That’s what <i>I</i> thought,” said Fay positively.</p>
<p>Sir Richard stared at the ceiling and the bright
electric cluster. “Let’s see,” he mused. “Ace-in-the-hole
Harry—what an awful monacker, Fay—was
arrested at the Crystal Palace for trimming a pigeon
out of his shirt—almost. Then he appeared again
at Bow Street charged with running a buffet flat in
the West End—Brick Street, I think. They fleeced
everybody there at banker and broker and baccarat,
or was it chemin de fer?”</p>
<p>“Don’t ask me,” said Fay.</p>
<p>“He paid ten pounds fine, I think, and disappeared.
Now, you say, he was on the boats with smoked-glasses.
Then those glasses had some close relation to the
cards. I think we’re getting there—”</p>
<p>Sir Richard’s right fingers crept to his vest pocket
in abstraction. He stared at Saidee Isaacs and then
dropped his eyes toward his vest. He brought out a
small ring upon which was a single flat key. He toyed
with this key as MacKeenon crept forward with the
loose pouches of his leathern jaw hanging down.</p>
<p>“Bring me the boxes!” he said, pointing toward
<!-- 255.png-->
the three tin boxes which stood at the end of the
table.</p>
<p>MacKeenon set them in front of Sir Richard.</p>
<p>“It may be, Mac,” said the chief. “It may be that
we have reached the end of the quest. There is something
in what Fay has told us, after all. He’s a bungler
and a fool and all o’ that, but he has enterprise. Suppose
you go back to the coach house and tell the driver
to give you those goggles from out the side pocket of
the tonneau of the car that brought you down. I
think I heard him take the car around the house. Tell
him I want all of the goggles he has got.”</p>
<p>The inspector glanced at Fay.</p>
<p>“Go on,” said Sir Richard, “I’ll watch him.”</p>
<p>“Now you, Fay,” the chief continued as MacKeenon
unlocked the door and vanished through the hallway.
“Fay, you can’t steal! You’re a shining mark for us.
You’ve got the nerve of the damned—but you overlook
the essential trifles. That finger-print up over the
transom in Hatton Gardens—for instance. The
dropped hotel-key in Chicago—wasn’t it? And now
the smoked-glasses. You should not have thrown
them away.”</p>
<p>“She told me I shouldn’t have done it,” said Fay,
turning toward Saidee Isaacs. He was surprised to
notice that the girl had stepped halfway toward the
door. Her eyes turned swiftly away from a spot on
the wall. She nodded her head as Sir Richard glanced
keenly at her.</p>
<p>“She told you, eh? She was right. A woman’s
intuition is a sound compass to steer by. Saidee has
<!-- 256.png-->
a clever brain—when she uses it. She helped get
these for us.”</p>
<p>Sir Richard pointed toward the first tin box. “She
aided in getting them through Switzerland. She did
well—but they are scraps of paper without the key
that will solve them. That key may lie in the smoked-glasses.
It may go deeper than that. You thought
it was a trifle. Let me tell you, candidly, there are no
trifles in this world. What do you wager that the
trifle you threw away solves the secret of the entire
German dye industry?”</p>
<p>“About three minutes start that it doesn’t,” said
Fay as he glanced at the girl out of the corners of his
eyes.</p>
<p>Sir Richard rubbed his hands and picked up the
nearest box. He inserted the key as the little old man
crept out of the gloom and came toward the table.
Saidee Isaacs took one step in the direction of the door
and the wainscoting near the chamfering. She stood
pensively, with her hands at her sides as MacKeenon
glided into the room and tossed a pair of yellow-tinted
goggles upon the table.</p>
<p>Sir Richard picked up these goggles and lifted a sheet
of paper out of the box. He held the glasses in one
hand—the paper in the other. His eyes traveled over
the lines of typing. He adjusted the goggles and leaned
his head forward.</p>
<p>Slowly the chief’s gaze ran from left to right and
back again along the sheet. He fingered the goggles
abstractedly. He moved his eyes closer to the page.
He drew them away—a foot or more.
<!-- 257.png--></p>
<p>“Not smoked enough,” he said musingly. “These
glasses won’t do, I’m afraid. They’re very weak.
Very weak indeed.”</p>
<p>Fay stood on the balls of his feet. He thrust a
hand halfway out toward his cap which was between
MacKeenon and the little old man. He waited then
with every nerve strained to the leaping point.</p>
<p>Sir Richard glanced at the electric cluster, blinked
his eyes, then resumed his scrutiny through the goggles
of the typed page. He lifted a second sheet and peered
at this. He seemed, to the poised cracksman, like a
scientist examining a beetle with a double microscope.
His brow darkened with a welling frown of annoyance.
His chin lifted slightly. His glance darted toward
Fay in final resolution. His eyes flamed.</p>
<p>“Mac, you may take him back to—” he started to
say when Saidee Isaacs’ fingers closed over the black
knob of the switch which controlled all of the lights
in the room. A click sounded like a revolver being
cocked. The place was plunged into inky darkness.
An exclamation of surprise came from the two detectives.
This was followed by a gasp from Sir Richard.
This last was mingled exasperation and wonder.</p>
<p>Fay heard, as he snatched up the cap and darted
after Saidee Isaacs, the quick, braying of MacKeenon:</p>
<p>“He’s goon, mon! Fay is goon!”</p>
<p>The inspector blundered against the half-closed door.
He bumped his head in the darkness. Recoiling, he
heard Sir Richard exclaim:</p>
<p>“Come here, Mac! Come here!”</p>
<p>Fay heard this cry as he leaped through the front
<!-- 258.png-->
door and sprang after the fleeing form of the girl.
He wondered at the reason for it. His feet did not seem
to touch the ground.</p>
<p>He gained her side as she crossed the dewy lawn of
a garden and glided through box-wood hedges which
led west and to another street than the one upon which
was the House of the Two Lions.</p>
<p>“Are they following us?” she asked, turning her
head and glancing at him. “Is anybody coming?”
she repeated, breathing swiftly.</p>
<p>“No! No!” he answered, staring through the dark
arch of green trees. “No, Saidee, they are not! No
one has come out of the house. I don’t understand
why they didn’t follow us—do you?”</p>
<p>“They’ve found something more important, then—”
she said intuitively. “I believe they have found the
key to the cipher!”
<!-- 259.png--></p>

<div class="chapter">
<h2 title="XV. Solved" id="chXV">
<span style="font-size:1.2em;">CHAPTER XV</span><br><span style="font-size:1.1em">SOLVED</span>
</h2>
<p>Fay valued his liberty too highly to turn back and
search for the reason of the inaction of MacKeenon
and Sir Richard Colstrom.</p>
<p>“This way,” he said to Saidee Isaacs as he pointed
toward a gravel-strewn roadway which wound around
a red brick house. “Follow me and we’ll work west
where they can’t find us.”</p>
<p>“But—” she said, turning and looking back.</p>
<p>“No, come on! There may be a trick in the way
they acted.”</p>
<p>She followed him reluctantly. The thought had come
to her that they were leaving something unanswered in
the House of the Two Lions. She turned for a second
time and sought it out. It showed dark and unimposing
through the dew-laden branches of the trees.</p>
<p>Fay urged her on. Their progress after the girl’s
second back glance was a dodging one wherein he took
every precaution. There were Bobbies about. Sir
Richard had the entire night force of Scotland Yard
to unleash upon their trail. The braying of the runners
out of Vine Street might be heard at any moment.</p>
<p>Finally, as they stopped by a fern-covered crescent,
a whistle shrilled which drove them into the shelter
of a clump of box-wood. The silver notes were
<!-- 260.png-->
repeated. They rang the air. They paled the girl’s
olive cheeks. She glanced eastward as if seeking protection
from Sir Richard.</p>
<p>Turning toward Fay, she moved her lips inaudibly.
He laughed with a sudden thought. The danger was
only fancied.</p>
<p>A four-wheeler with an ancient nag between the
shafts, clattered around a square. It drew up under
a low arc light and took aboard a passenger who replaced
his whistle in the pocket of his mackintosh.</p>
<p>“Two blasts,” explained Fay, “brings a deep-sea
cab. One—a hansom!”</p>
<p>She glanced up at a corner lamp and said:</p>
<p>“Kentwater Road! I’m not going any further!”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>She turned and stared toward the east. “Do you
remember Sir Richard saying ‘Come here, Mac, come
here?’”</p>
<p>“Yes, I do.”</p>
<p>“What did he mean by that? Why didn’t Mr.
MacKeenon follow us? He could.”</p>
<p>Fay hesitated. He went back over the scene in the
great room where Saidee Isaacs had switched off the
lights. “Yes, he could,” he admitted finally. “I
wonder why he didn’t?”</p>
<p>Her hand grasped his overcoat sleeve. “I believe
they found the cipher-key! Don’t you see—they
must have found it!”</p>
<p>“They found something more important than us.”</p>
<p>“We’re going back!”</p>
<p>“No! I don’t think we had better do that.”
<!-- 261.png--></p>
<p>“Yes we are, Chester. We’re going back and give
ourselves up. Isn’t your freedom less than the key to
the cipher? Think what it will do to the world. Think
of the benefit of it.”</p>
<p>“I’d like to know,” he admitted, staring in the direction
of the House of the Two Lions. “I’d almost take
a chance to find out.”</p>
<p>“Come on back. We’ll soon know. It’s the only
thing to do, Chester.”</p>
<p>He felt her arm within his own. They retraced their
steps. A motor car with H.M.S. plates dashed swiftly
by them. A second car turned into the street upon
which was the House of the Lions. It was evident that
something of moment had happened. Fay thought
he recognized a familiar figure in the tonneau of the
first car. The man, whoever it was, held the steady
poise of a prime minister.</p>
<p>Fay stopped and drew Saidee Isaacs into the cove
of a hedge. He glanced out and south along the street
upon which was the House of the Lions. Three great
motors stood there with their flaming electrics burning
cones of fire in the night. A figure in tweed passed up
the stairway and was admitted through the front
door.</p>
<p>“That may have been the Prime Minister,” said
Saidee Isaacs.</p>
<p>Fay stared upward at the leaden vault of the London
sky. He was between two minds. The House of the
Lions might be a cunningly-baited trap of the superior
order.</p>
<p>“Come on, Saidee,” he said, throwing away his last
<!-- 262.png-->
resolve for safety. “We’ll go in the house. We’ll see
Sir Richard. If it’s a trap—they’ll never give me
another chance for a get-away.”</p>
<p>She thrust her hands in the pockets of her skirt and
leaned toward him.</p>
<p>“I never knew Sir Richard to play false,” she said.
“He’s too smart a man to do anything like that. I
don’t think we needed to run away.”</p>
<p>Fay arched his brows. He followed her down the
sidewalk and turned with her into the pathway which
led to the House of the Lions. He stood on the steps
as she knocked lightly. The three motors were blocking
the road. Their chauffeurs were huddled in the
front seats waiting for orders. They all had the
appearance of sincerity. Fay entered the door after
the girl.</p>
<p>Sir Richard beamed through the gloom of a half-illuminated
hallway. “Ah, my runaways!” he
chuckled. “Come right in! We’ve company of note
tonight—a cracksman, a lady of class, a Prime Minister,
an M. P. and the Secretary of the Home Office.
I want you to meet them, Fay. They are terribly
interested in how you found the secret of the German
dye-cipher. You should have stayed until the discovery,”
he added with cryptic smiling.</p>
<p>Fay allowed the girl to precede him through the
doorway which opened into the large room where
stood three men who held themselves like Empire-builders.
These men stared curiously at Sir Richard
as he motioned for MacKeenon and the little Scotch
detective to take places at the door.
<!-- 263.png--></p>
<p>The chief of the investigation bureau rounded the
table, drew up a chair and sat down. He leaned forward
and fastened upon Saidee Isaacs and Fay the
level scrutiny of a man who was vastly pleased with
the turn of affairs. He rubbed his hands and beamed
upon the company. In some manner, his strong jaw
had softened. The bulges at the sides were not so
prominent.</p>
<p>“Germany,” he began speaking, “is checkmated.
All that sad country knows about making dyes shall
now be known to England and America. The secret
is out!”</p>
<p>The smaller member of the group of three men, whom
Fay surmised was the Prime Minister who had fought
Germany to a knock-out, stepped to the table and
threw back the lid of the nearest tin box. He brought
forth a sheet of paper between his steady, well-manicured
fingers. He held it out with a smile.</p>
<p>Sir Richard reached for this sheet as he darted a
sly aside toward Fay.</p>
<p>“We have here,” said the chief, “an ordinary
piece of fairly good typewriting paper. It was
made in Germany. It contains thirty-two lines of
letters—grouped three letters together. They read
‘aaahhhsssaaacccstopxxxgggssstttstopmmmwww’ and
so on. It has long been suspected that the cipher was
written between the lines or on the back of the sheets.
No chemical reaction that we tried brought any satisfactory
result. We tried them all. It remained for
chance to solve the puzzle in a satisfactory manner.”</p>
<p>Sir Richard glanced at the cluster of lights that
<!-- 264.png-->
bathed the room in white. He blinked and held out
the sheet. He reached and picked up the pair of
tinted goggles which MacKeenon had brought from
the stable.</p>
<p>“These glasses,” he said, “are not sufficiently opaque
to answer the purpose. Fay,” he added with a twinkle,
“you are to be complimented on your enterprise.
You <i>took</i> that safe, in the country north and east of
here, like Haig took Cambrai. You held the secret.
You lost it and gained it again. You threw it away
and then thought better of the matter when you followed
the cardsharper to see why he wore smoked-glasses.
I know why he wore them!”</p>
<p>“Why?” said Fay quickly.</p>
<p>“Because he’s a genius in his own peculiar line. I
hope to have the pleasure of sending him away sometime.
With the kind of glasses he wears, no man is
safe in a friendly poker game.”</p>
<p>Fay stared at Saidee Isaacs. She crimsoned over
the memory of the thirty-odd pounds she had lost to
Harry Raymond.</p>
<p>“I’d like to know how he does it?” she asked.</p>
<p>Sir Richard laid the sheet of paper on the table.
He tossed the tinted glasses to one side as he rose and
pointed toward the snap-switch on the wainscoting.</p>
<p>“Turn it off, Mac,” he said. “Put this room in
complete darkness. Then we’ll all see the answer to
the puzzle. It was too simple for the best cipher
experts in the world to solve.”</p>
<p>The inspector reached upward and snapped off the
switch. The room was plunged into Stygian darkness.
<!-- 265.png-->
Fay widened his eyes and tried to make out details.
There was a glow from the side windows which gradually
brought out shadows.</p>
<p>“Come here, Chester,” commanded Sir Richard.
“Come around the table and stand by my side. Look
over my shoulder and tell me what you see on the
paper. Keep yours eyes shaded with your hands to
shut out all light. Now, what d’you see?”</p>
<p>Fay rounded the table and glided to Sir Richard’s
side. He leaned over and strained his eyes as he stared
blankly at the paper.</p>
<p>He saw nothing but fine black lines at first. He
cupped his palms and pressed them to his temples.
He moved his head back and forth from the page.</p>
<p>“Keep at it!” said Sir Richard with a positive
chuckle.</p>
<p>Fay strained his glance. He saw then the first white
glow of fire which moved phosphorescently between
the typed-lines. It steadied. It disappeared. It
came again—this time more prominently.</p>
<p>“Good God!” he exclaimed. “It’s there!”</p>
<p>“Yes,” said Sir Richard. “It <i>is</i> there! What do
you make out between the first and second line? Be
careful, don’t touch the paper. That’s it—what do
you make out?”</p>
<p>“<i>Werke-Maintz</i>,” said Fay.</p>
<p>“Go on—it reads easy after your eyes accustom
themselves to the dark. What’s between the next lines
of typing?”</p>
<p>“<i>Der est</i>.... <i>Blau die</i>.... <i>Alizarine</i>.... <i>Sapphire</i>....
H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub> ... HNO<sub>3</sub>—”
<!-- 266.png--></p>
<p>“And the next?”</p>
<p>“<i>Carbanthrene Blau</i>...?”</p>
<p>“Yes, and indigo and all the fast colors are there.
They are worked out to the minutest details and
formulae. They throw the field wide open to the world.
There will be no more secret dyes!”</p>
<p>Sir Richard grasped Fay’s right arm and continued:</p>
<p>“D’you see the trick, now? The trifle—lighter
than any air? D’you see what baffled the cipher
experts of four countries for two years?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I see it, now,” said Fay. “The formulae are
written in radium.”</p>
<p>“Radium salt, which is white, upon white paper!”
blurted Sir Richard. “The only way you could <i>ever</i>
see it—is in the dark!”</p>
<p>Fay straightened his back. He tried to pierce the
gloom in the direction of Saidee Isaacs. He glanced
down at the table. The sheet of paper had been
whisked away by Sir Richard, who placed it in the
box.</p>
<p>MacKeenon switched on the light. The room was
filled with dazzling brilliancy. Sir Richard pointed
to the sheath of cipher papers which were piled in the
tin containers.</p>
<p>“See anything there now?” he asked Fay.</p>
<p>The cracksman passed his hand over his eyes and
stared at the topmost sheet. The cipher-writing had
vanished. The lines of letters, which had been typed
for a blind, alone showed.</p>
<p>“Now I know,” sad Fay, “how Ace-in-the-hole
Harry worked the gulls on the passenger boats. He
<!-- 267.png-->
wore heavy smoked glasses and marked the backs of
the cards with phosphor or luminous paint. It was
the same thing as putting the light out—as far as
he was concerned.”</p>
<p>“The trifles!” chuckled Sir Richard. “You threw
Mononsonburg’s key away. Those glasses were thick
enough and dark enough to read the writing on the
sheets in daylight. The secrets of the German dyes
are written between the lines by a fine pen dipped in
radium salts.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister drew out a flat watch and consulted
it. He turned toward two men high in the
Government whom Sir Richard had called.</p>
<p>“Gentlemen,” he said, “we must be going. Sir
Richard has entertained us exceedingly. I’d sum the
matter up by saying everything was tried except
putting out the light. But then, who would have
thought of so simple a thing as that?”</p>
<p>Sir Richard nodded to Saidee Isaacs.</p>
<p>“She thought of it!” he exclaimed. “The credit
goes to her. I’ve no doubt she thought she was helping
a pal—but she did more than that.”</p>
<p>Fay thrust his hands into the side pockets of his
coat and declared: “You’re right, Sir Richard! That
little lady did us a good turn. I don’t see how Scotland
Yard can get along without a woman inspector
or two. I never heard anybody say that a member of
the fair sex would overlook a trifle.”</p>
<p>The Prime Minister was in the act of placing his
hat on his head. He bowed, instead, and passed Saidee
Isaacs as he stepped toward the door. He was followed
<!-- 268.png-->
by the silent members of his Government. The door
remained open. The great motors throbbed with life.
The clash of their gears woke echoes in the house as
they started away.</p>
<p>MacKeenon and the little old Scot remained in the
doorway. They glanced at Fay and the girl. Their
eyes swung toward Sir Richard, who had seated himself
in the chair which was before the three cipher
boxes.</p>
<p>Keen-sniffing, the two detectives waited for the
order. A chain clicked in the inspector’s side pocket.
He shifted his weight to his right foot. He glanced for
a second time at Sir Richard.</p>
<p>“Mac!”</p>
<p>MacKeenon started and stood erect.</p>
<p>“Mac,” repeated Sir Richard. “Mac, you may
take these three boxes, with the cipher solved, over to
the big safe in Scotland Yard. Give them to Cragen,
who will be responsible for them.”</p>
<p>The inspector hesitated and glanced at Fay.</p>
<p>“Go on, Mac!” said Sir Richard sternly. “Do what
I say. You and Simpson shall guard them over. Leave
me alone with Fay and the girl. Shut the door when
you go out.”</p>
<p>Fay watched the two baffled Scots lift the tin boxes,
cram them under their arms and start down the hallway.
The door slammed. MacKeenon, in passing,
had kicked it with his foot.</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs bobbed her hat and flashed a glance
at the door. She turned and walked toward Sir Richard.
She paused and stood in the center of the room. The
<!-- 269.png-->
chief of the Criminal Investigation Division had
dropped his chin on his breast in an attitude of profound
abstraction.</p>
<p>Fay softly moved to the girl’s side. The two remained
silent and thoughtful over the period of a long
minute. They watched Sir Richard like quick-witted
children. Their eyes, although different in color,
contained the same steady stare.</p>
<p>“You were a fool,” suddenly said the chief without
lifting his chin. “You blundered and blundered and
blundered, Fay. You did everything wrong. And
yet everything wrong came out all right in the
end. I think I’ll have to both condemn and praise
you.”</p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs took one quick step toward the table.
Fay stopped her with a reaching arm. There was
a quizzical smile on the cracksman’s face. He had
read Sir Richard aright.</p>
<p>“I think—” started the chief of the investigation
division, “I think that you are just a bad boy grown
up.”</p>
<p>Sir Richard sat bolt upright. He leveled a steady
finger across the polished surface of the table.</p>
<p>“You’re a fool in a fool’s paradise. You can’t move
contrary to fifty million people, and get away with it.
There is a place for such who break the laws—a
house with a Thousand Doors! What have you got to
say, Fay? Do you want to go back to Dartmoor—or
do you square it?”</p>
<p>Fay reached upward, fingered his lapel and removed
the little silver greyhound. He tossed it to the table
<!-- 270.png-->
with a quick jerk of his wrist. He stood with folded
arms.</p>
<p>“I’m ready to go,” he said, “if you won’t trust me—,
all the time!”</p>
<p>The chief’s eyes narrowed to slits of steel. His
fingers reached across the table and snatched up the
insignia of the King’s couriers.</p>
<p>“Come here,” he said to Saidee Isaacs.</p>
<p>She glanced at Fay, then moved around the table
and stood at Sir Richard’s side.</p>
<p>“You may take this trifle of esteem and fasten it
upon Chester’s lapel, again,” the chief said. “We
always have a place for men like him.”</p>
<p>Fay overheard the order and stepped swiftly
forward.</p>
<p>“I’ll take it,” he said, “on one promise. Just
one!”</p>
<p>“And what is that promise I’m to give?” asked Sir
Richard smilingly.</p>
<p>“On your solemn word that you’ll trust me next
time you send me out on a mission.”</p>
<p>“My word for that, Chester. You’re too high-spirited
to lead the life you were leading. You’ll have
your chance now. The war is over—peace has been
signed—but England and your country are just coming
into their own. Look at Mesopotamia and Arabia
and Africa—look at Russia and the Balkans. We’ve
got to send men there for certain purposes. You’ll
do nicely! There’s no better commission in the world
than the one I offer you. It’s free-lancing!”</p>
<p>“I’ll take it,” said Fay.
<!-- 271.png--></p>
<p>Saidee Isaacs glided forward and pinned the little
silver greyhound back on his left lapel. She stepped
away with her head thrown high.</p>
<p>Sir Richard leaned over the table. “There’s moderate
expenses goes with that,” he said. “Now you’ll be
getting salutes from the Bow Street runners instead of
dodging them. Are you satisfied with the turn of
affairs?”</p>
<p>Fay smiled as he hooked his arm with Saidee Isaacs.
“We’re going now,” he said. “I’ll report tomorrow.
I’ll be subject to your call in all cases except putting
men in prisons—I draw a line at that—Sir
Richard.”</p>
<p>“Good-by!” boomed the chief. “Good-by, Saidee!
See that he watches his step!”</p>
<p>Fay opened the door and led her down the hallway.
They stood on the porch between the lions. They
passed down the gravel walk.</p>
<p>Turning and glancing back, she said:</p>
<p>“Sir Richard is a gentleman!”</p>
<p>Fay raised his left hand and fingered the little silver
greyhound. He was silent as he led her northward and
then toward the West End of London. They both
heard the chimes of Big Ben on the House of Parliament.
Its notes were striking over the housetops of
the city.</p>
<p>They passed through deep aisles of yews and poplars
and sturdy English oaks. They reached Rose Crescent
and the road which led to the river. Their arms were
linked as a policeman stepped out from a clump of
box-wood and eyed them intently.
<!-- 272.png--></p>
<p>Fay saluted with his left hand to his plaid cap.
The “Bobby” stood with his great red palms on his
knees. He smiled slowly—broadly.</p>
<p>They vanished in the gloom of Rose Crescent—merged
as one. The Bobby sighed. He could not
have drawn down a fairer picture of contentment had
he called upon the highest stars.</p>

1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be

agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See

claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the

you share it without charge with others.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style="display:block; margin:1em 0">
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
